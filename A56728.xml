            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>MY Author has here undertaken a great and generous Design, which is to offer a Project for Re-establishing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion in its ancient Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Purity, wherein it appeared in the Primitive Times; Likewise for easing Christians of the heavy Burdens they have groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by humane and unnecessary Constitutions, since then▪ im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on us; For freeing us also from the Miseries and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities we suffer by reason of the many Divisions amongst us, and for restoring us to that Liberty in Religion which Christ and his Apostles left us, whereby all Christians might be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an unity in Communion.</p>
            <p>He asserts that the Fundamentals of Christian Religion are not very many, being comprehended and clearly expressed in the Holy Scriptures; for it would be a great Presumption, to question whether or no those Rules and Doctrines were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the attainment of our Salvation, which are there proposed as the necessary Duties of a Christian, by our Blessed
<pb facs="tcp:107899:3"/> Saviour Christ himself. And I cannot think, but that if these plain Fundamentals, which are universally owned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all that profess Christianity, were rightly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished we should find they contained so great Truths, as if religiously observed, would be sufficient to bring us to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life.</p>
            <p>When the Apostles declare they have revealed to the Church the whole Counsel of God (both in the <hi>Credenda</hi> and <hi>Agenda)</hi> that was requisit to Salvation; What Credit can we give to those who impose new and unnecessary Matters on our Faith and Worship? May not such Persons be justly accounted the Authors and Promoters of our Divisions? The Apostles Creed having been always acknowledged to contain a Summary of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles of our Faith, and been approved, ever since their times, by all Christians; as many as sincerely believe it, and all the evident Consequences thereof; if they also believe the Holy Scriptures, from whence that has its Original, they cannot be said to be in any Error of simple Belief, offensive to God, nor out of the hopes of Salvation; How then can any pretending to be Christians, justifie the Persecuting of their Brethren, who are known by the same Denomination, and the treating them as Hereticks and Reprobates, only for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with them in things not necessary to be believed as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith? For I must esteem as such, all those which have not the express Word of God for their Warrant, clearly and plainly laid open to vulgar Capacities; and know not how any New Article, which was not such in the Apostles time can be made so now. <hi>Id verius,</hi> saith Tertullian, <hi>quod prius, id prius quod ab initio, id ab initio quod ab Apostolis. That is truest which was first, That first which was from the Beginning, That from the Beginning, which was from the Apostles.</hi> Those diligent Publishers of the Divine Oracles, did
<pb facs="tcp:107899:3"/> in Things of Indifferency, which were not of absolute concern to Salvation, leave us to our Liberty, requiring only a mutual Forbearance and Condescension towards each other in them: They took not upon them to find any Defects in the Methods which their Great Master had deliver'd to them. What shall we say then of those who have Ordained other Laws and Practices, with a <hi>Damnabitur</hi> on every one who observes them not? Can this be thought less than a Presumptious Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to supply the Rules which God in his Sacred Word gave us, as if his Divine Wisdom had left them to us imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? Now if we can thus blame the unreasonableness of such as would force us to go by Rules, neither prescribed in the Scriptures, nor ever practised by, or known to the Primitive Church, for the first Four Centuries, we then in like manner ought to be tender how we deal so with others.</p>
            <p>And since it is the Duty of every good Christian to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, as much as in him lies, the Peace and Ʋnity of the Church: It would be happy, if those who dissent from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship of the Nation wherein they dwell, would comply in matters indifferent, as far as they can, without offering Violence to their own Conseiences, and that those who have a Power over them, would also condescend somewhat on their parts, since there might perchance be as good Reasons given for the Compliance of the one, as of the other. And in order to this happy Ʋnion of Christians, great care is to be had, not to load the Publick Forms of Devotion with any of those Private Fancies upon which either Party differs, for that will be to render these Divisions incurable to the Worlds End.</p>
            <p>The Constitutions of Christs Church are disposed as much as may be, for bringing within its Pale all true Christians, and those who would confine it to narrower Bounds, by hindering the encrease of its Members, and excluding them for slight
<pb facs="tcp:107899:4"/> and unnecessary Causes, do eclips its Glory, and lessen its Grandure; which is altogether contrary to the Practice of the Primitive Christians, who made no scruple of admitting into their Communion, all who professed not some deadly Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or were not guilty of Idolatry, knowing themselves obliged to bear with the Infirmities of the Weak: Now if this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Virtue of Charity be absolutely necessary to Salvation, as no Man can deny, Ought we not to embrace those as our Brethren who differ from us in some Externals only? For a certain those Churches or Communions, can pretend to very little Charity, who not only thrust out from among them, as not fit to be accounted Fellow Members with them, but also violently Persecute, as utter Enemies to Christ, all who refuse to conform to their Methods, tho the Difference be but about some Trivial Ceremonies, or Things which will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Dispute. Whereas none can be truly reputed to be Separate from the Church of God, but such as separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from their just Duty to God, cease to be Good, and throw themselves into a state of Damnation.</p>
            <p>And tho it must be acknowledged, that Ceremonies have a considerable Influence on the practical part of Religion, since they raise in the Minas of Men, a due sence of Respect and Reverence towards God in our Devotions; yet they being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to so great a Number, without regard to the Apostles Rule of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> Why should we not distinguish amongst them, and retain only those which are of Help to us in the performance of our Duty to God, reject all such as any ways obstruct it, and esteem those as indifferent, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute neither to the One, nor to the Other; Having always a regard to the Circumstances of Persons, Times and Places, which may perchance require various Methods herein: And there must also be a Charitable Bearing one with another, as
<pb facs="tcp:107899:4"/> well in respect of those Ceremonies so retained, as in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, or held indifferent.</p>
            <p>St <hi>Augustine</hi> complained of this in his time, <hi>Hoc nimis doleo,</hi> says he, <hi>quia multa quae in Divinis Libris Saluberri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma praecepta sunt nimis curantur, et tam multis Praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus plena sunt omnia. I am very much troubled that so many Things, wholsomly commanded in the Holy Scriptures, are so little regarded, and that all Things are so full of Presumptions,.</hi> August. Epist. 119. And in the same Epistle says again, <hi>Quamvis contra Fidem not sint, tamen ipsam Religionem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Altho these Things be not against the Faith, yet they so much oppress our very Religion with servile Burdens, which God of his infinite Mercy would have to be Free, under very few and plain Sacraments of Divine Service, that the State of the</hi> Jews <hi>is much more tolerable than the State of the Church of Christ; For the</hi> Jews <hi>tho they were Strangers to Christian Liberty, yet were they subject only to the severe Burdens of the Law of God, not to the Devices and Presumptions of Men.</hi> I wish we could herein follow the Practice of the first Christians, who tho they differed in some of their Rites and Ceremonies, yet whilst they owned the same Faith, they joyned still in the same Communion, looking on these Things but as Externals, or simple Ornaments which had nothing in them of the Essential Parts of Religion.</p>
            <p>If this were well considered, it might in some measure abate the Heats of those fierce Champions, who are so Zealous in defence of that particular Church or Sect, whereof they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves Members, and so much exasperated against all others of Different Sentiments, that they could be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to destroy them. <hi>Odia Religionum sunt acerrima.</hi> These Men would have the Rules of their Faith and Worship to be the Standard to all other Christans. So <hi>Procrustes</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:107899:5"/>
               <hi>Athenian Robber</hi> measured on his Bed those he got into his Power, and as many as he found not of his own Demension he cut off shorter, or extended them on Wracks till he made them of the just size.</p>
            <p>Most of our Presses are now employed on Books of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies in Religion, of which many are so fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rcely penn'd, that they rather seem Defiances to Combate, then sober Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince Men of their Errors, and bring them to be of their Faith. Such Polemick Writers conceive <hi>the overflowings of their Gall, to be the only demonstrations of their Zeal; and that the irregular Heats which waste the Vital Spirits of Religion, are the most soveraign Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials to support them.</hi> And tho we ought <hi>not to blame those who earnestly contend for the Faith of the Gospel, which was once delivered unto the Saints:</hi> Yet sure the Apostles meaning could never be to encourage this Contest by Menances, by reproachful Language, and by scandalous Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Itch of Disputation has now so universaly tainted us, that a Man can scarce go into any Society, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e it even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Taverns</hi> or <hi>Coffee-Houses,</hi> but he shall be entertained with a <hi>Convivium Religiosum.</hi> This has raised such a Ferment in the Nation, that it seems as if the old Factions of the <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibellines</hi> were revived and got over amongst us; when if the Subjects of many of these Disputes, which they pursue with so much Violence and Passion, were carefully examined, they might possibly appear to be about some▪ strange Notions or Speculations in Divinity, where Men vainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to explain or define what is Incomprehensible, or else concerning Matters indifferent, which might be left to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood one way or the other, without prejudicing our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>'Tis an amazing thing to think, that any Sect of Men should act so contrary to the Rules of their Profession. Let us
<pb facs="tcp:107899:5"/> look back on the many Wars and Persecutions made by some Christians against others; Let us consider the Inquisition, and divers other Severties practised by our Neighbour Nations on account of Religion, and I am sorry we are able to produce so many Instances of Cruelty, not very far short of those, even here amongst our selves; with all which should any sober <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> be made acquainted, were it possible for him to imagine that we owned a Gospel of Peace: O that those who persisted in doing these Outrages they▪ are unwilling to Suffer, should profess Obedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce to that Christian Law of <hi>Love thy Neighbour as thy Self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not the greatest part of our Quarrels arise from Things hard to be understood, and which will admit of ambiguous Sences and Interpretations? Should we not then be very cautious of putting too great stress on such nice Points of our Religion, lest by so doing we weaken the Nerves of the most substantial Ones? Certainly if these Methods, by which we are to be guided to our Everlasting Happiness, and which we are commanded to search for in the Holy Scriptures, were so intricate, and their true meaning so difficult to be found out, as certain Criticks would make us believe; I cannot imagine they would have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to all Men in general; for methinks it would be very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, that any abstruse Notions which cannot be comprehended by the meanest Capacities should be enjoyned us, as absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be believed, since that would be to expose the Poor Ʋnlearned and Ignorant sort of People to inevitable peril of Damnation, who have equal right to the Merits of our Blessed Lord and Saviours Death and Passion, with the Greatest Men, and most Profound Doctors. I shall conclude with this hearty wish, That we could not only Conform in the Rules of our Faith, but come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The Authors</hi> PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF it be a great cause of Grief to all true Christians, to see the Sacred Religion, which the Son of God brought down from Heaven to Earth, miserably torn in pieces by so many different Sects, which heretofore have, and who still divide it at this present: If all these several <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of Faith,</hi> which dismember the Spouse of Jesus Christ, do extraordinarily afflictall Pious Souls; surely they should conceive no less Grief at this thing, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto there has never been any one, who undertook to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Healing Remedy to these Wounds, that has attmpt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with Success, the Cure of so great a Mischief. It se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ms no more now to be thought on, but as an Evil to be deplored, and absolutely incurable. Every one imagins him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self strictly bound to adhere to his Old Principles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived Opinions: Every one Flatters himself in his own thoughts, and believes, that he possesses the Truth, and is in the Right Way; after which he looks no more on others, but with some kind of Aversion, or, at least, with Pity; They, in the judgment of Him and his Party, are as so many Unfortunate Creatures, ready to tumble down an unavoidable Precipice; They are considered as People that are only fit to be the subject of the Prayers
<pb facs="tcp:107899:8"/> which are offer'd up for Miserable Wretches, or of the Complaints which are made to lament their unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Neither are those looked upon who would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to remedy this Evil, but as Idle Projectors and Fantastical P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rsons, like Mountebanks, who promise the Cure of those Diseases that are given over by the most skilful Physicians.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that many have studied to find out a Means of According some of these Sects, by Re-uniting certain Persons together, who have been engag'd in them, and who, on this account, have reciprocally entertained most implacable Feuds against each other. There have been divers Writings published for endeavouring an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation between the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Protestants:</hi> They have attempted to Reconcile those of the Confession of <hi>Ausburb,</hi> vulgarly stiled <hi>Lutherans,</hi> with such as are called <hi>Calvinists;</hi> but there have commonly been other Interests than those of the Glory of God, intermixed in these Und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtakings. It has rather been by a Principle of Policy, than any Motive of Conscience, and desire of the Salvation of Souls, that these Designs have been set on foot; whence it has happened, that God has turned his Blessing from them, and made the Success not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Greatness of the Design.</p>
            <p>Some likewise, not aiming at any thing herein more than how they might make an easier Passage, and more plausible Revolt, from One Communion to Another, have only studied to weaken the Foundation of their former Opinions, and strengthen that of their New ones, which they have an intention to Embrace. There is also this in it, that Men do not ordinarily attempt, but to remedy some Effects, without ascending up to the principal Cause
<pb facs="tcp:107899:8"/> and only Source of all this Evil; not unlike those Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Physicians who unskilfully labour to cure some of the Symptoms of a Disease, without applying any thing to the grand Original Cause, on the curing whereof depend all its Consequences.</p>
            <p>There was a Preface of a Book, Printed some Years since, in the Low Countri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, which touched this Matter, and seemed to aim at a General Reconciliation of all Christians, by means of a Charitable Allowance, and a Mutual Toleration. But besides that it was but by the by, that the Author treated upon this Important Subject: It seems that, not having ascended up to the Original of all these Divisions, he has not contrived any proper Way for the Reconciliation which he proposes, nor has rightly distinguished between what is Fundamental in Christian Religion and what is not, to let us see, last of all, in what things we should have this Charity one towards another. And we reject also the Means which is most important towards the attaining to so good an end, whilst we refuse to disingage our selves from whatsoever may render it Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, as I shall shew you in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>It was in search of This, that I have, for some Years past, applied my self to so diligent and serious Meditation. I utterly cast off, at the instant, all Former▪ Opinions of my own, and Prejudices against others, which might be any Obstacle to me in so laudable a Design: I disingaged my self for a time from all things whatsoever, of any Communion of Christians which was Singular, and which separated it self from others: And I believed, that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining carefully the things wherein they All agree, I might discern with a more disinterested Eye, that which would be for the Common Good. I then considered with all
<pb facs="tcp:107899:9"/> the exactness I was able, the Nature, Greatness, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Effects of this miserable Division of Christians. I observed at the same time, how Inestimable would all those Goods, and all those Advantages be, which would arise from their Re-uniting into one and the same <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith,</hi> and the Reconciliation of their Minds into the same Communion. After that, I diligently considered with an intire Applying my Mind, what could be the Causes of so deplorable a Misfortune: I have ascended the best I could to the very Fountain Head of this Evil, where, I suppose, I have made some Discoveries, which, without question, will be relished by those who shall look upon them without a Worldly Interest.</p>
            <p>In short, I am verily perswaded, that after all my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, my continual Prayers have been heard by the Goodness and Bounty of the God of Peace: I hope, that through the Blessing of Heaven, I have met with the True and Only Remedy of this Evil, that is to say, the sole Means of Reconciling together all those who make Profession of Christianity, and who are perswaded, that the Doctrine of the Gospel, which is comprised in the Scriptures of the New Testament, is delivered to us from God, and that it contains what we should Know, Believe and Do for our Salvation. So that as soon as we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously Re-unite, in those matters which It prescribes us, we shall be in a ready way of attaining to the Mark which It proposes. At least, I may, with Truth, say, that since that very time, I found, for my Own part, a great Calmness of Spirit. I have not any more, since then, looked upon Christian Doctrine, to be Difficult, Knotty, charged and encumbred with an infinite number of Subtil Questions, Critical and Unprofitable Notions. These
<pb facs="tcp:107899:9"/> are the very Things that have made it pass Unknown, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving utterly Disfigured its Natural Beauty: This is it that has given it a Face altogether New and Strange; and that if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the Apostles should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, this very day, upon Earth, they would not know this Doctrine, so Disguised as it is. And this is the main Thing that has created these miserable Divisions among Christians.</p>
            <p>I must confess, that, for a great while, I had a design not to publish my Thoughts upon this Subject: I would have concealed the Advantage, that I had met with, and made it of particular use to My self; Which was not for any Envy that I bare to the Publick Good, for which I could be glad to apply all my Power and Life: But I distrusted my Own Abilities, and knowing, as I do, their utmost, I have ever been suspicious of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>
            <p>Besides this, I never approved of that Liberty which is taken of exposing all our Thoughts to publick View, or to say more properly, all those Whimsies which we conceive in our Studies. This is to do a great prejudice to Men of Learning, to steal from them the Time which is so dear to them. 'Tis staying them to pick out Good from bad Writings, that is, to search for some Grains of Gold amongst Heaps of Sand. It is to busie the Press about Fruitless Works, which ought not to be employed but in the most Excellent: It is, lastly, to entertain the Ignorance of the Vulgar, who are not able to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Books, and who, many times, being drawn by a Specious Title, are afterwards observed to be more deeply engaged in Ignorance and Error.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:107899:10"/>
            <p>Moreover, I know that the Opinions of the Publick are very slightly to be regarded, for People ordinarily pass their Censures upon other Mens Works, according to the sway of their own Passions. Whence it comes to pass, that Perverse Judgments are made on the most Innocent Designs. I fancied, that some would be saying of me, I was but in Jest and Trifling; that others would imagine, I acted herein by some of those Motives which I had already observed and condemned; and that many also of those who did not absolutely disapprove of my Thoughts, might say, This indeed is a Thing rather to be desired than hoped for, and that therefore all these at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts would be without Success. Neither am I ignorant how Curious this Age is; That now a days much Seasoning is required to the Choiest Meats, and that if the most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Subjects be not accompanied with a Studious and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Stile, they discourage the Readers, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e thrown aside as Merchandise not worth looking on: And it will be a hard matter for me, at above Sixty Years of Age, to contrive a Stile that shall carry with it such an Air and Neatness, as shall please the Refined Wits of our Times.</p>
            <p>But after all, I thought that I ought not to quit a Design so profitable and so important to the Publick Good, for some Objections of small Consequence; that the Matter ought more to be esteemed than the Form. I considered that Diamonds should not be thrown away because they are Rough; and that the Golden Oar has always its Value, although it hath not yet attained to the Luster which the Crusible gives it, when its pure Body shall be separated from the Dross and Earth which obscure it. The least Articulate and Weakest Voices are kindly heard, when
<pb facs="tcp:107899:10"/> employed to advise us of our Good, and to conduct us out of some Unsafe Course. And perchance it may so happen, that some or other of the Learned Men of this Age, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by my weak Endeavours may worthily accomplish what I have but rudely essayed; and thus it often happens, that the unskilful Play of some indifferent Musitian stirs up those who have a more delicate Touch, to correct the Defects of what they hear by the excellency of their Hands and Skill.</p>
            <p>All these Considerations, after sundry Debates, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to upbraid my self in termes not much unlike the poor Leppers of <hi>Samaria, 2 Kings, chap.</hi> 7. These Wretches having met with great Treasure, and a quantity of Provisions in the Camp, which the <hi>Syrians</hi> had left behind them, blamed themselves for keeping in their Possession a Good which might relieve all the Inhabitants of their City. I have therefore, at last, taken my Pen in hand to communicate to the Publick, the Fruit of a Meditation, to which I have applied my self for a long time.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured in this Little Work to follow a Familiar Method accommodated to the Humors of all sorts of People; wherein my principle Aim is to make all Christians, even the most Weak and Ignorant, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Nature of that Religion which they profess, by bringing it back to its First Principles and Fundamental Doctrines: But to attain to this End, it must be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in its Naked Dress, by clearing it from whatsoever may render it Obscure, Ridiculous and Barbarous.</p>
            <p>I strive to make my self understood by all the World, and to proportion my Thoughts and Expressions to the Capacity of every one. To which effect I have divided
<pb facs="tcp:107899:11"/> this small Treatise into Three Principal Parts: In the First I shall let you see the Nature, the Extent, and sad Consequences of this lamentable Division, which is among Christians; The Greatness of the Evil should make us know how urgent and pressing is the Necessity of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The Second will discover the Causes of the Evil, by laying them open even to their very Source Head. And lastly, the Third will set forth the Soveraign and Infallible▪ Remedy which may be employed for the Curing and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this grievous Wound.</p>
            <p>If I perceive this Work to be seriously entertained, &amp; that it shall produce any Good Fruit, I will bless God for it, with all my Heart, since it is only his Glory that I propose for the sole Object of my Design. And I will further beseech him to bestow on me so much Health and Strength, that I may be able to make this Treatise be followed by Two Others, which may be of no less Importance: One of them shall be concerning the Counsels which Christian Princes and States may take to make this Enterprise succeed aright, by preserving their true and lawful Interests, and those of private Persons. The other shall be to dispose all those who are out of the Pale of Christianity, utterly to cast away from them all those Prejudices which blindly retain them in their Antient Religions, and hinder them from seeing the Advantages of that which the Eternal Son of God has given us; so that they shall see how even Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reason, do powerfully invite them to submit to the Gospel, by a perfect Obedience; and how that is the only Meanes to enjoy a real Tranquility of Mind and a solid Quiet of Conscience. This will sufficiently serve to excite Christians (after their Re-union shall be procured) to contribute, on their parts, towards the Salvation of all
<pb facs="tcp:107899:11"/> the Inhabitants of the World, with whom they shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any Commerce,</p>
            <p>And as there is nothing so repugnant to the Design, I have in hand, as the Prejudices wherewith it may be lookt upon; for they are these Prejudices which have so much fomented and strengthened this Division, and which would also be capable to destroy the Fruit that might be hoped for from this Project: So I have, on this occasion, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as much as in me lay, not to give the least Hint that should seem to favour any Prejudice whatsoever. I have avoided, as a Dangerous Rock, giving the least suspicion that I am Interested for any Party, and content my self without taxing any One in particular, to blame in general whatsoever hath caused these Divisions, and whatsoever entertains them at present.</p>
            <p>'Tis for this reason, I have not been spurred on to this Design by any Motive of Vanity, as to acquire the Honour of having undertaken an Enterprise which never any man proposed before; and likewise to take away all Distrusts which my Profession or my Condition might give: For I know well enough, that if the <hi>Protestants</hi> did belive this Project had been contrived by a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and especially by a Clergy-Man of that Religion, they would think partially on it, and that he was engaged by Interest to favour those of his Communion: And on the contrary, if the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> were perswaded it was the Work of a <hi>Protestant,</hi> or of a <hi>Greek,</hi> they would immediately reject it. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, the Aversion they have to those whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend are out of the Church, would make them refuse the most saving Remedies, because it would be presented them by a Suspected Hand: It is just as a Sick Person takes not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut with great fear, any Medicine which is prescribed him

The same may be said of all other Communions, which are found among Christians, for they look upon one another with so much Jealousie and Suspition, that only the very Thought that so laudable a Design had been laid by a Person not of their Communion, would be sufficient to make them reject it without further Examination.</p>
            <p>But to draw to a Conclusion; I doubt not but that some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons when they consider the Nature of the Remedy which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for the Cure of this Evil, shall esteem▪ it as a thing Easie to be Conceived; that they will say, This Idea was no more than what any Man might have thought on: That it is a Project which, at the first, is very Specious, and finds no great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at a slight Consideration of it, but will meet with such as are Unconquerable, if any one undertake to set it on Foot. But besides the great Advantage it is, to have a Means of fancying such an Idea as is accompanied by that of Peace and Concord, the only Names of which are capable of raising an excess of Joy in the Hearts of all Men; I hope so to unmask this Design, and discover such a Face, that all shall understand the Foundation, the Possibility and great Advantage thereof. For I pretend not to put an End to this Great Work without answering to the Principal Objections which may be made against it. And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise (as I have said before) another Treatise, wherein, in case This shall be favourably received, I will propose a Means how to make this Project succeed: I shall let you see how the Power and Authority of those must be employed, who are in a capacity of working successfully in it. And I beseech God to send down his Blessing hereupon, and guide all to his Glory, to the Good of his Church, and to the Comfort of all those good Souls, who shall sigh after so Holy a Re-union.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen St <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>That it was necessary there should be Heresies amongst us, to the end that such as are approved might be made manifest.</hi> His Words must not be taken, as if he would by an extravagant Paradox, Authorize the diversity of Opinions in Christianity. For his design was never to favour the Authors of Sects, and Heads of Parties, by imposing Silence on those who would Remedy Divisions, and put a stop to their sad Consequences. But he declares plainly, what we must expect from the ill Disposition of the Spirits of Men, by reason of the high esteem they have of their own Sufficiency, and of their inclination to render themselves Considerable, by some singular Opinions in matters of Religion. He designs by the same means to make us see how the Providence of God, which draws Good out of Evil, and Light out of the thickest Darkness, takes occasion from thence, to distinguish such as appertain to him; making appear by this contradiction of Sinners, the constancy of the Servants of God, and their generous resistance to all sorts of Temptations and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107899:15"/> Tryals. It is in this sence also, that <hi>Jesus Christ▪</hi> declares to us the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecessity of Scandals and Tribulations arising in the Church, and that he is come to kindle the Fire-brand of War in the World, and to put Divisions in States and Families; for otherwise the Gospel, which is the Ministry of Grace, and a Word of Reconciliation and Peace, does not of it self propose any thing but Union, Amity and Concord. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, although sprung from the same Original as Grace, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations quite distinct: It is not pleased, but in Diversity, and seems not to subsist but by the Contrariety of Qualities, which occur in its Works; whereas Grace is not preserved, but by the entire Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence of those who have a share therein, and by the Conformity of their Opinions. We cannot divide our selves in its Principles without destroying it to us. For this Separation is to give it such grievous Wounds, as will force it to retire from those who are not more careful to improve it, by such ways as are most suitable to its Nature.</p>
                  <p>Now, is it not a most deplorable thing, that an occasion should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, of making use of a Doctrine of Peace, for the miserable tearing in pieces a Body, whose Members ought to be perfectly united? Is it not a shameful thing that this unhappy <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> should be introduced to make the same havock in the Church, it ordinarily makes in the World? Philosophy never saw so many Sects: <hi>Paganism</hi> so many different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions: <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As soon as the Sprouts of this Holy Seed began to appear upon the face of the Earth, we saw at the same time an infinite number of unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and choaking Tares spring up, sufficient to destroy that in its birth, which would bring with it Salvation and Life. Almost in the sight of the Holy Apostles, (those Sacred Confidents of our Soveraign Master) there arose such as vaunting themselves to have embraced his Doctrine, would have represented him after their fancies, and set him forth as their own whimsies and cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> numbers up Fourscore several Heresies, (or rather different Opinions) which▪ had crept▪ in amongst the Christians, and yet not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107899:15"/> mentioning the divers Branches into which these Heresies were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided▪ There is scarce any one Article of Faith, or any Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christianity, whereon strange Opinions have not been advanced, which in time have made Sects, and different Religions. And we know that every particular Combination has appropriated to it self the Name of a Church, and boasted to be the Spouse of the Son of God, to the utter Exclusion of all others. They have also gone further, for besides the Heavenly Doctrine contained in the Gospel, where they have taken occasion of raising Disputes: They have forged such as have been meerly humane, concerning which there have been also mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Divisions. And as though these Men had climbed up to Heaven to consult the very Mouth of God himself, they have preached up their Doctines as Oracles, and Fundamental Truths. After which they have had no great trouble to engage their Followers to suffer the most cruel Torments and even Death it self in defence of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and then have confidently enrolled them in their own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend, as Martyrs of Jesus Christ, though they Suffered only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Glory and Reputation of some Arch-Heretick. So God, to chastize the Rashness, and confound the Vanity of their thoughts, has permitted, that Division should ruin their Work, as heretofore it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Insolent Designs of those who would erect the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we have once forsaken the Royal Road which God has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed us, we run into all By-paths, and separate our selves one from another, each of us fancying to be in the most commodious and safest Way. Can you likewise believe, that a Separation is sometimes made about Subjects, not only light and trivial, but in some sort ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and which do redound to the Shame of those who made them serviceable to the Ends of their Schisms and Divisions? What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions have there not been among Christians, namely, On what Day the Celebration of <hi>Easter</hi> should be observed; If, in the Communion, Bread Leavened or Unleavened should be made use of; If the Body of Jesus Christ were Corruptible after its Conception, or not; If we may say, that One of the Trinity was Crucified; If the Church can Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and Excommunicate one that is Dead; If the Hallelujah might be Sung in <hi>Lent,</hi> and other Questions of the like Nature? Behold here what are ordinarily the Subjects which cause these most real Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Behold that which separates those, who with one consent should advance the Glory of their Common Master.</p>
                  <p>But to come to our Times, and more nearly to touch upon the Evil
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107899:16"/> which troubles us at present, and which has given me occasion of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open my sence, to contribute to a Remedy: Is it not a lamentable thing, and of sad Example, to see Christians so miserably divided, as they are at this Day? For, to let pass the divers Sects of Christians, which are in the <hi>East,</hi> and who have more cause to grieve for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Divisions, then for their miserable State, under the rigorous Yoke of <hi>Mahometans;</hi> such are the Greeks of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Circassia,</hi> the <hi>Nestorians, Jacobites, Maronites, Cophtes,</hi> Christians of St <hi>Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> People who are looked upon as Hereticks or Schismaticks, and yet who believe that out of their Communion there is no Salvation to be expected; Let us insist only upon this deplorable Condition of the Christians of <hi>Europe,</hi> in these Countries wherein we live. There is no Heart so hard, that does not Sigh to behold so strange a Dis-union; There is no truly Christian Soul, that does not Grieve to see the effects of the implacable Fudes and Hatreds which are amongst those who are looked upon as Brethren; since they are thereby exposed to the continual Insolences of the sworn Enemies of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>Since this great breach made in the Western Church, by the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Protestants from the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> What Bloody Wars! How many Murders and Massacres! What Changes and Subversions in States! have there not been seen, insomuch that they have not stuck to have recourse to the Common Enemy, whence they have drawn in Succour against those with whom they should have entertained a true Brotherly Affection? But that which is most deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is, that this Division hath been followed with a infinite company of others, and as a fruitful Mother hath produced an incredible number of Monsters, which resemble it. These two great Branches growing one from the other, have also sprouting out of them, a vast company of lesser Branches, which although not equal in Strength, bring forth Fruits altogether as dangerous as their Mother. Among Protestants, how many several Sects in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries, &amp;c.?</hi> There needs but some diversity in the Habits of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, some difference in the Ceremonies, or Ornaments of Churches, or of the Government thereof, to form a Sect. A simple dissenting in the Liberty which every one allows himself of expounding according to his Fancy, the Mysteries that are above his reach, is sufficient to cause a Separation. The manner of explaining the subject of Predestination, and of Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onciling Gods Grace with the Motions of the Will of Man, makes us look upon those who are of a different Opinion, as People who are in the high-way of Damnation, and with whom we must not entertain any Communion.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107899:16"/>
                  <p>Nor may they who have lived in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> insult at this Division of the Protestants, and pretend that Union and Concord have continued amongst them without any Division: For although they all submit themselves in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Authority of one only Head, and that they look upon him as the Center, wherein all the Lines of their Society do meet and are re-united, nevertheless we are not ignorant how great the Number of their Dissentions are, and how little the Union is amongst their Doctors: So that if the Fear of a Superiour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority seems to retain them in one and the same Society, their Hatreds are but the more fermented within. They do not less condemn one another of Heresie, and of being out of the way of Salvation. And the Examples of our Age have shewn us, that when Opportunities have been presented of making their Aversions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how far they have carried it, being always desirous that their particular Opinions might prevail over all others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not any particular Interest, that I here endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, but it is the general Interest of all Christian Societies; It is the Good, and the Union of all those who march under the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the Cross. I design to re-unite together all the Christians of the East and West, <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> Catholicks and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and all the divers Branches whereinto these latter are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided.</p>

                     </gap>n those of the Glory of God, and our Salvation, which could so quickly make us bend to them. It many times happens that our Education, our Customs, our particular Advantages, and such other Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations do easily turn the Scales. And that indeed which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buseth us herein, is, That these are slipt in so dexterously, and mixed in such a manner in our Disputations, that we cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, but by strong and frequent Reflections.</p>
                  <p>But let us put the Case, that a Man who has an extraordinary Light by the Knowledg of Tongues, and reading good Books, may wade through these Difficulties, and sow his Doubts among these Perplexities; What shall we say of so many common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who have not had, nor even been in a Condition to have, all these profitable Helps, I mean, so necessary for the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into these profound Mysteries, and carrying them through that Labyrinth? Is it because that Christian Religion is not propos'd, but only to the Learned? Is it not as well addressed to the Ignorant, to Women, to Children, and to the poor unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pesants? Must we not rather say, That it is towards such that it turns its most favourable Aspect? That whilst the Doctors are disputing with great Earnestness together, about the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, the most Simple do forcibly take it by the Ardour of their Zeal. Therefore what can we point out more contrary to the Peace and Consolation of these good and simple Souls, than this great Diversity of Opinions, of Sects, and of Religions?</p>
                  <p>But if it should be objected, That for want of reading, and necessary Study to Search into the most sublime Mysteries of Religion, these ordinary People would be content with what is most plain and most clear in Christian Doctrine, which will suffice to inspire them with the Love of Virtue, and the fear of God; and will be capable to give them Peace of Conscience, and all inward Consolation necessary for them. I shall readily answer, that this is all I demand, and to which I endeavour to reduce all Christians in general. The Christian Religion is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually proposed to all, and in the Distribution of its Graces, it make; no Distinction between the Learned and the Ignorant: The High-towering Wit, and that which cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ps among the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107899:18"/> Vulgar; as the Remedies and Medicines which Nature offers us, work in the same manner upon Persons of all Conditions and Degrees. So that to be a Man, suffices to qualify us for laying claim to the Advantages which Grace presents to Us in the Doctrin of the Gospel, and to lay hold of the Aids which it gives us, to make Us Partakers of it.</p>
                  <p>But should it be likewise objected for the clearing this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Point, that those who have not the Means and Advantage of penetrating into these Secrets, by a deep Meditation, may consult the Learned to resolve them, in the Choise which they should make of a good and sure Opinion: Who does not see, in the First place, that is not the way to draw them out of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wherein they are, seeing▪ they do not address themselves, but to Men who are not Infallible, and who may be pre-possessed with Prejudices, and have their particular Interests; so that they shall be always in Doubt, whether or no the Advice which was given them, proceeded not from some other Principle than the Glory of God, and the Charity, and Desire of promoting the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls. Moreover, should this Address be made to some of those Doctors who follow different Opinions, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour they are obliged to examine all things, and retain what is best: Every one will alledg in his own Favour, all the most plausible Reasons and Considerations which he can, and many times those that are least valid, are most specious. After this, can a Man of mean Parts find out in himself Light enough, and discerning to carry him through those Difficulties, which make a Separation amongst Men of far greater Parts, and more refined Judgments than his Own.</p>
                  <p>But last of all, what shall we say of the poor Labourer, or simple Tradesman, who has ever been bred in a Country, where some one of these Sects prevails? We know, that such a Sect forces those of the Country perfectly to acquiesce in it: That it requires every one to submit, without any Contradiction, to all that it shall prescribe: That there are some Sects, who suffer not their Followers to enter into any Discussion of what they lay down to follow, and compel them to a blind Obedience. As for Example, what can a poor Soul do, who has been born in the midst of <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> where Reigns a most severe Inquisition, or in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107899:18"/> the farthest Parts of <hi>Denmark,</hi> or <hi>Sweedland,</hi> where are none but Protestants, when he shall learn that there are other People else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in great Numbers, who are called Christians, boasting themselves to have Truth in its greatest Purity, and doom all to Eternal Torments who are not of their Opinion? Is it not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a poor Wretch in this condition, not being able to have any Commerce, nor Conference with those of whom he hath been told this, will have so much more Trouble in his Mind, by how much his Passion is greater that stirs up in him a Desire of his own Happiness? Which makes us see the Necessity of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together all Christians under one common Principle: And this Principle must contain Maxims, Easie, Intelligible and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable. In a Word, this Principle must be such, that it may produce Peace and inward Comfort, and guide all the Faithful, by the Practice of Holiness, to the Enjoyment of an Immortal Crown.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Principal Design of the Gospel, and I dare say the only one, is to bring Men by the Knowledg of its Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to the study of Virtue, and to conduct them by the Practice of this Virtue, to the Enjoyment of Happiness and Glory. So that we may say, That the sacred Chain of our Salvation hath Three Links, to wit, the Knowledg of Truths, the Practice of Virtues, and the Possession of Happiness. And if this Salvation be compared to a Building, the Revelations of the Gospel may be said to be the Foundation and Basis of it, Celestial Glory is the Covering, and Virtue that which joyns these Two Extreams together, making us pass from the Knowledg to the Possession of the Object known, where all our Felicity resides. So that whatever gives any Impediment to this Knowledg, the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs

The principal Part whereof, consists in the Piety and Zeal, which we bring to the Service of God. And the principal exercise of Piety consists in the Sacred Commerce, which the Faithful entertain with their God, by Prayer. So that whatsoever troubles our Prayer, the same brings a notable Prejudice to a Life of Holiness. If, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> teaches us [1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7.] the idle domestick Contentions, which arise from the want of Unity between Husband and Wife, are capable to interrupt our Prayers, and blast the Fruit of this saving Exercise; what shall we say then of the Contentions which divide the Christian Church into so many different So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties? How can we expect that our Christian Vows should u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>One of the principal Means required for our right observing of Holiness, is the Repose and Tranquility of the Soul: Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness also and Moderation are necessary, which make us look upon things without any Prejudice, and the engagement of particular Interests. If then (as we have plainly shewed) this Division throws us into such Disquietness and Trouble, every one may judg how prejudicial it is to the Notions of true Piety. Is it not certain, that if we would employ in the Study of Piety and good Works, the Time which we allow our selves for the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all those Questions which divide us; We should quickly make great Progress in the Way which leads to eternal Life?</p>
                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Antoninus</hi> exhorted those who were desirous to advance in the Practice of Moral Virtues, to desist from the reading of Books, chiefly such as treated of Philosophy, as being only a Hinderance to their Design. If, said he, any should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee to read, do thou immediately answer, I have no time to busie my Head about these things; I have a greater and more important Affair in hand, which requires a Man's whole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107899:19"/> Attendance. My Business is to tame my Passions, and to make my self every Day a more virtuous Man, and to discharge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If Holiness be no other thing than a precious Crown, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of all Christian and Moral Virtues, I believe there is none but will grant me that the fairest Flower of that Crown is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards our Neighbour, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Bond of Perfection, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. Now this Virtue consists in loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as our self; considering that he bears the Characters of the Image of God; that we enter both one and the other into the Communion of the same Society, and that we are called to be made Partakers together of one and the same Inheritance. This admirable Virtue is so excellent, that some, with good Reason, call it the Soul of Religion, the Fountain of all other Virtues; or to speak more properly, Virtue it self, which takes divers Names, according to the Diversity of the Subjects whereon it is exercised. It is called Piety, when it looks up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to pay Homage to its Soveraign; we call it Charity, when enclining towards the Earth, it studies to do good to its Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Servants: In a word, it receives the Names of other Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as of Temperance, of Modesty, of Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when it is reflected back upon its self, by the Motions of that Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Love, which it bears it self. Therefore if this Monster of Division be capable to destroy Charity, which establishes the Essence of Holiness, it is manifest, that nothing can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more prejudicial to Virtue, than the Dis-union and Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mens Minds: And as Charity proposes nothing but Peace, Union, and Concord, for its Aim is straitly to tye the Knots of a Holy Amity, there can nothing be so diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Opposite to it as Division, which cutting all these Knots,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107899:20"/> and breaking these sacred Bonds, does divide all that which should be most united.</p>
                  <p>To confirm this Truth; Let us make a Parallel of the Effects of this Charity, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus reckons up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. with those which Division produces. Charity is of a patient Spirit, Division is Turbulent and Unquiet: Charity is Kind and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, Division only spreads Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>titor: Charity seeks not its own Ends, is not Dispiteful, and thinks no Evil. These ill Qualities are the true Characters of Division, in which it hath no other End, than the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its own Party, to the Detriment of all others. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity rejoyces not in Injustice, but altogether in the Truth; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision oppresses the Truth, and is never pleased, but with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness and Violence: Charity Endures, Believes, Hopes, and bears all things; Division causes Suspicions and Jealousies to arise, gives ill Interpretations to Actions, and even to the most innocent Words, and drives us into Passion and Impatience, into Murmuring and Extravagancies. And to draw the last Line to this Parallel, God grant that as Charity never fails, but is maintained in the very Ruin of all that which is most Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and most firm in Society; so on the other side, by the Rule of Contraries, that we may qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IN all Divisions, which tear in pieces Kingdoms and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, each Side at the first does boast by their Manifestoes and Declarations, that they took not up Arms but for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Good, and for maintaining the Crown and Authority of the Prince: And although those Parties be so contrary and averse, that their Swords are drawn, and in a readiness to decide their Quarrel, yet both of them have the confidence to alledge in their Vindication, the Justice of their Cause, and Interest of their Soveraign; whilst in the End, all tend to the utter subversion of the State, and total change of the Government. And it will many times happen in these Contests, that the most Mutinous and most Seditious, do make themselves Masters of Soveraign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. So is it ordinarily seen, that in the division of Opinions in Religion, every one protests, that no other Argument or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest perswades him to follow the Religion that he embraces, but the real Love of Truth, and desire of his Salvation. All those who would be the Promoters and Spreaders of some new Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shew an extraordinary Devotion and Zeal at the beginning, but by little and little all that degenerates, and all the Overtures which Division makes, serve but as so many Doors, by which, at last, Impiety, Irreligion, and Atheism do slip in. 'Tis amidst these Differences that we commonly see some new Religion thrust in it self among us, which differs but very little from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of all Religion.

And I do not believe but that the great diversity of Judgments and Religions, which we see at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Christianity, hath been the cause of this coldness and

                     </gap>se different Questions, but the true Reason of it is, because they are not indeed capable of it. Such are all Peasants and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, and others, who know nothing more than what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to their Employments, and who, being taken out of that,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107899:21"/> are as if they were in an unknown Countrey, where they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant both of the Ways and Language: It puts them to a stand, as though they had neither Sence nor Motion: They make all their Devotion, and all the Service which they should pay to God, to consist in the well-observing these outward Actions of Religion in which they have been trained up. Witness the poor Christians of <hi>Muscovia,</hi> all whose Religion is no more than just a shewing to those who desire to be informed of their Belief, the Image of some Saint, which they carry about with them. And others also, who think that if they know but how to make the Sign of the Cross aright, may pass for very good Christians. Therefore, if, instead of puzzelling our selves about so many Questions and Controversies, we would study to bring back the Christian Doctrine to its true Principles, which are but few in Number, and easie for all sorts of Persons to comprehend, it would be the ready way to make True Christians, who would know what is really Essential in their Doctrine, and so would quickly be brought to a true Piety, and to the Fear of God, which is the only Design of Christian Religion.</p>
                  <p>Here it may also be added, That this great diversity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions begets a strange Prejudice in certain Spirits: For there are many who would make us believe, that Truth is so evident and perceiveable, by all where it is reveal'd, that it shines as the Sun, which dims the Light of all the other Stars. Wherefore they conclude, that if Christian Religion contains those Saving Truths which came from God, were brought down from Heaven to Earth, and attended with Glory and Miracles, it would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obscure with its Splendor all seeming Truths, which strive to have a counterfeit Lustre to resemble it. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they see that every one of these different Opinions upholds it self by such probable Reasons, that many are staggered at the consideration of them: They cannot be perswaded that this Gold is to be found in the Earth, because it doth not immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to them its glittering Light. And as they cannot conceive that it is sit for them to remain one Moment in suspence for the separating of Truth from Falshood and Errour, they forsake both one and the other, to secure themselves from the Danger of being forced to a new Change: Those Persons would certainly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107899:22"/> refuse to take a Sum of Money, (if offered them,) out of a distrust▪ that they should not know the Coines, and that they should not discern False Money from Good: Whence we may judge, how gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns. Those who are without the bounds of Christianity, as▪ <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> may justly reproach us, with the want of a true understanding amongst our selves. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve how to settle (will they say) your different Opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you go about to perswade us to follow you. First unite your selves sogether, and then we will consider whether or no we shall unite with you. And since Unity and Verity are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable; How, in this great Difference of your Opinions, shall we be assured that you will propound the Truth to us? And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there can be no greater Scandal to our Religion, in the Sight of those without, than this deplorable Division. The <hi>Sieur de la Boulaye</hi> [Chap. 18.] In his Voyages to the <hi>Levant,</hi> saith, That the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving this vitious Excess of Strife, and multitude of Divisions amongst Christians, have confirmed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by this Means in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r own way, and think God to be the Author of them. 'Tis by Reason of this, St <hi>Paul</hi> says [Rom. 2.]
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107899:22"/>
                     <hi>That the Name of God is despised, because of us, among the Gentiles.</hi> And yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad Lives, and Extravagancies of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, do not bring so much Prejudice to Christian Religion, as the diversity of Opinions in its Doctrine. Of the First it may be said, That these are but the Faults of certain Persons, whose Profession is not answerable to their Religion: That that may be innocent, though they are criminal, who pretend to follow it. But when the Evil is in the Opinions; it may be thought that the Defect is in the Doctrine it self. So that they have some Reasons to offer their Objections against it, and to suspect the Truth of the whole. Therefore if it be the Purity of the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, rather than the Deportment of particular Persons, that must draw us to one Communion; without all question, that which results from this Doctrine, will make a greater Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Mens Spirits, than that which only regards the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of some few Men.</p>
                  <p>'Tis generally observed that things are not maintained, but by the Aid of that which first contributed to their Production. The same Influences of the Heavens, which made those Seeds sprout up, that the Earth hath been intrusted with, serve likewise to raise the Plants to their Perfections. Therefore some ambitious and unsteady Brains have taken Occasion by the Division of Christians, to give Birth to a Sect, which hath utterly departed from the Fundamental Principles of Christianity; for it was by the Means of this Dis-union, that a new Religion hath been formed, and a false Prophet substituted in the Room of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, who alone inspired all the true Prophets. It is not to be wondred then (such Divisions continuing in the Church) if these poor mis-led Souls remain confirmed in their Opinions; and since that which first alienated them from us, still remains, the Aversion which they have to our Mysteries, remains likewise. So long as the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies were well united, that their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders held a perfect Understanding amongst themselves, and their Souldiers were kept in a true Obedience and Submission to their Orders, other Nations endeavoured to procure their Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with great Eagerness; they esteemed it a Glory to enter into Alliance with this People, and many have made no Difficulty to receive their Yoke, to whose Dominion, they thought all others
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107899:23"/> ought to submit: But so soon as Mis-understandings happened between their Generals and Souldiers, and Revolts amongst the Subjects, other States despised their Alliance, and took up Armes against them, plainly seeing that they were not Invincible, since they were subject to Division. Just so, our Dis-union makes us an Object of the Contempt and Aversion of all other People. After this, can we think it strange, that so many Exhortations, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Writings, which have passed continually amongst Christians, should make so few real Proselites?</p>
                  <p>In the Apostles Time, One Sermon alone converted many Thousands of Infidels to the Faith. At the End of St <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, Three thousand Souls, by Baptism ranged themselves under the Standard of the Cross. [Act. 2.] It was also at that same time that all Christians dwelt together with one common Accord, and had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll but one Heart, and one Soul. Whereas at this present, we drive back by our Divisions those whom we invite by our Exhortations. But if it should be objected, That the Church makes now great Progress in the <hi>Indies;</hi> I dare say, with Pardon for my Opinion, That these poor People have not yet attained to the Knowledg of our Divisions, and that if they should unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>stand them, their Zeal would quickly wax cold, and all these Conquests would be of no long continuance.</p>
                  <p>When the Protestants first separated from the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> so long as they kept an Uniformity in their Opinions, they made marvellous Progress, the Union which was amongst them drew a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> to their Profession: But so soon as they divided themselves into several Branches, they have put a Stop to their Conquests, and had no further thought, than to maintain themselves, both those whom they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, and such as have forsaken them.</p>
                  <p>And it is not only from the ill Example of this Division, that Strangers to the Faith are driven from it: But they are dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the very Intrigues and Stratagems of the Christians, who are so separated and divided among themselves. Their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision creates such Animosities one against the other, that they do their utmost endeavour, to hinder those who have an earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est desire to embrace Christianity, from entring into any other Christian Communion, but their own.

So that as it is impossible for Iron equally drawn between two Loadstones, to move either towards the one, or the other. So these different Sollicitations which Christians make to draw Infidels to them, leaves them in a Neutral State, not knowing which Side to take, nor to which they should determine their Judgments.</p>

                  <p>THe Evil of this Division is not limited only to particular Persons, but all Societies, as well Ecclesiastical, as Civil, have too great a feeling of it: For we daily see strange Tempests happen in both, which had no other cause for the forming of them, than this sad Dis-union. And has not the Church much reason to complain, that those who are called her Children should tear out her Bowels? That she can expect nothing but Death even from those to whom she hath given Life? Since they to whom she continually administers the Sacred Milk of her pure Doctrine, and of her wholesome Instructions, do give her so many grievous Wounds, as they form Sects in her: In multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they dis-member Her, and each striving to draw her to their Side, at last nothing is seen to remain, but her mangled and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Pieces. And what is more, these deplorable Reliques of the Church, have likewise been so miserably handled, that she is no longer to be known; insomuch that they might rather be taken for the Parts of some mishapen Monster, than for the Members of the Divine Spouse of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> washed in the Blood of her dear Lord, and clothed with the Sacred Robe of his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

                  <p>There are those who many times do hazard, on this Occasion, all that they hold dearest in the World, even to their very Lives; which passes in every One of these Societies, for an Exquisite Zeal, and an examplary Devotion.

                  <p>Moreover, there are no Fewds to be compared to those which spring from the Hearts of Persons dissenting in Religion: And till these Fewds cease, and an Union be made, we must never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to see that the States of Christendom should well agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107899:25"/> to resist the Common Enemies of their Profession, and put a full Stop to their Progress, who never prevailed but by means of our Divisions, nor advanced their Conquests but by help of our Mis-understandings.

                     </hi> Power; What would it do, if the Armies of all Christians were joyned together to repress the Insolency of an Enemy, detesting so much the Name of a Christian? 'Tis now most visible that he had not been Victorious, but because we did not defend our selves: He gained no Ground, but meerly for want of our Opposition; and gave us no Wounds, but by those Gashes which we gave our selves. If we would all stir by Agreement, for the Glory of our Common Master, and help to push forward what is already so succesfully begun, for advancing the Standard of Christ: All those Advantages which we promise our selves from the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we gain over our Fellow-brethren, are not comparable to those which would accrue to us by our Conquests of these braving Enemies. And let not those Christian Princes, whose Territories ly far distant from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> flatter themselves in their own Thoughts, with the Advantage of their Scituation; for should those Frontiers, which serve at present for a Bulwark to Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have been once mastered by the <hi>Turks</hi> (as of late they seemed in danger to be) they might have forced a Passage into the Heart of the most remote Countries▪ I wish with all my Heart, that the Drums and Trumpets of these Infidels, may be a means to gather Us once more together, and be as a Signal to put us in mind of uniting our selves quickly, and labouring altogether for our own Preservation.</p>
                  <p>In the last Place, this Consideration may be added to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ones, to make us see the Evil that this Division causes in States. Let us suppose that in a Kingdom, or any other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an State, those who govern it, should perceive they have been mistaken in the Opinion which they have held; and that seeing they have not the Truth on their side, they are in danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Souls. I dare affirm, the Nature of this Division is such, that it would be very difficult, nay almost impossible to procure their own Salvation, and the Salvation of those who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107899:26"/> are under their Authority; the Interests of State are so mixed and woven with those of Religion; the Intrigues and Alliances, which are made with those of the same Communion, are so strong, that in going about to separate them, it would endanger a loss of all. As for Example, If a King, who is a <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k, should come to believe that the Foundations of his Religion are not sound, that (as the Protestants alledg) they contain certain Principles that are prejudicial to the Salvation of Souls.</p>
                  <p>Who does not conceive but that this Prince would meet with impregnable Difficulties in going about to set his Conscience at rest? Is it not certain that so soon as he should discover his Thoughts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is Subjects would be in Danger to rise up in Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against Him? The whole Body of his State would endeavour to oppose his Designs, and his Allies be apt to forsake him, to side with that Party that should be against him? The same might be said of Protestant Princes. The Politicians, who oppose themselves to any Change or Innovation in Religion, of what Nature soever it be: Who look upon it as a Flame that must be quenched in the instant, would strive to render all the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of a Prince unprofitable, that should have any such Thoughts. Therefore by this it is evident, that it is the Ground and Interest of all Christian States, to endeavour the healing of these Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as well for their own Subsistence and Preservation, as for the Safety and Quiet of the Consciences of those who Gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So Christian Doctrine, the same which was given us by the Son of God, and proposed to us by his Apostles, is most pure and most Holy: But it has been much abused by the ill
<pb facs="tcp:107899:27"/> Qualities of such as have handled it since those blessed Times: It hath passed through foul Hands, which have made it lose much of its Original Beauty. The Universal Passion, and that which chiefly raigns amongst Men, is Vanity and Pride; and that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is it, which has given the first Soil to Christian Doctrine. There have been some, who have thought it too plain and too course, for Wits higher than the common Level. Every one of those who have fancied themselves to have any degree of Light above others, have had a desire to cloath it after their own Mind. Many have believed they had a Right to interpose their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the most profound Mysteries; yea, some have been so raw and bold, as to add of their own Heads what they esteemed necessary to its Perfection: And this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is, that has given a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the great Diversity of Opinions, which are at this Day in Religi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hence has it come to pass, that some learned Doctors having m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> the first Advance of their particular Opinions in Religion, Others having come afterwards (thinking no less of themselves than the former) have taken a Liberty of examining their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, and have further thought they were obliged to overthrow them, and establish others, by which Means they hoped to make themselves famous, in being the Authors of a new Opinion, and Founders of a Sect. The first carried by the same Motive, which at the Beginning had induced them to propose new Doctrines, were not willing to recant them; for it is not so much the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the Truth of what they have broached, that obliges Men to persist in it, as the Fear and Shame of disowning that which they have once asserted, and that New-commers should be able to discover their Faults, and teach them any thing. So th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> every one standing up for their own Notions, and being unwilling to let themselves be run down, and vanquished: This impertinent Self-conceitedness, has laid the Foundation of these great Divisions.</p>
                  <p>This Evil might in some Measure have been suffered, if Such had been contented to declare their Opinions, as the meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of humane Wit: And if particular Persons keeping them within their own Breasts, had left others the Liberty of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, either to receive, or r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ject them, according to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107899:27"/> Judgment that they should make of them. But as when some thinking they want Credit to establish what they are desirous to put in Practise, have commonly Recourse to a superiour Authority, whereby they procure that to pass in their Favour, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would not have been confidered of: So all Parties contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Matters of Religion, and not believing themselves suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently strengthened by their own Reasons and Authority, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently declare it to be the Interest of God, and his Cause, that they defend; and every one of these particularly, protests that whosoever rejects what he delivers, rejects the heavenly Doctrine, throws down the Pillars of Christian Religion, walks out of the true Church, and exposes himself to Eternal Damnation. So that drawing thus straightly the Bonds which should engage Men's Consciencies in their Parties, they have occasioned particular Animosities, widened the Division, and rendred the Evil more incurable. For whither will not the Wit of Man carry him, when he shall be possessed with an Opinion, that whatsoever he does, tends to the Glory of God, and the Salvation of his own Soul?</p>
                  <p>There are Two different sorts of Spirits, to whom the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel is proposed; the First are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>old and Active, the Second Timorous and always very Distrustful of themselves: The former easily undertaking to establish new Opinions, and to give Beginning to Division; the latter contributed not a little to the fomenting and increasing of it, through their Timorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Facility, not daring to depart from what their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors have prescribed them. And as in Seditions, the Forward and Busy Spirits are they which raise the Tumults, and stir up others, while the Rabble being prepared by some artificial and plausible Declaration, finish the Disorder by the Liberty which they give themselves, and is allowed them by the grand Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers: So it is in Religion; for the ordinary People being natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ignorant, cannot hit upon the right way, but by chance; it must be their great good Fortune, or to say better, a divine Conduct which must guide them to it, and not any Choice or Search of their own. And yet the most inferiour sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are they that are fiercest and most eager in maintaining the Religion which they blindly follow, and whereof t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

'Tis therefore from this popular and blind Passion, that the Grand Leaders, and Politick Heads of Factions, serve themselves to strengthen their Sides, advance their Designs, and take away all Means of Reconciliation between Party and Party.</p>
                  <p>Now these Heads of Sects, and all those, who following their Principles, pretend to have a Share in their Glory, do play ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Game, to attain more easily to their Ends; which is this, They strive many times to engage the Politicians in their Cause, making them believe that their Doctrine is the most proper to hold the common People in Subjection, and in Obedience to their Superiours; that it prevents all manner of Insurrections, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Rebellions. In effect, I believe there is scarce any Sect of Christians, which does not boast to have this Advantage above others; they tax all those who oppose their Tenents with building upon such Foundations as are only fit to bring Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

'Tis well known what the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks say of the Doctrine of the Protestants on this Subject: 'Tis also well enough known on the other side, how the Protestants reproach them, by reason of the Power which they seem to give to a Foreign Nation to conquer such as deny Obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority. Whence it comes to pass, that according to the Face which the Politicians set on these things, they favour those whom they suppose do contribute most by their Doctrine, to the Peace and Quiet of States, which is their Soveraign Good. Likewise when a Religion is once esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in any State, it is the Prudence and Care of those who govern, that makes them strive to prevent any Change thereof, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough the Minds of those who have embraced Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may be diversly disposed; yet they all agree in this one Point; That there are certain Doctrines in Religion which are Essential and Fundamental, and others likewise of less Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. They all acknowledg that there are some, from which they cannot depart, without doing a manifest Prejudice to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to the Salvation of Souls; and that there are also others, to which they may adhere without wounding their Consciences. But there could never yet any Boundaries be agreed on, which should be established for the right setling all People in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural Limits: Every one would make his own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pass for Fundamental, and absolutely necessary to Salvation. Whereas had we but well distinguished betwixt these two sorts of Doctrines, had we but laid good Foundations to keep these Tenets hereafter from being confused, this Evil of which we complain, might easily be remedied, and all Parties might be Re-united, as I undertake to make appear to you in the Third Part of this Treatise.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, who does not evidently see, that for want of knowing rightly how to distinguish between these two sorts of Doctrines; the greatest part of the Divisions which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107899:29"/> Christians, is observed to arise? How many Questions are there, as Unprofitable as Curious, which have made a separation in Mens Judgments? How many Persons, without ever having examined or understood them, have sided, some with one, and some with the other, only that they might not be suspected to be without Religion, without Devotion, and without Knowledg? How many Disputes likewise are there which have no other Founda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

'Tis certain, that would they examine the Foundation of their Contentions, without Passion, and without Prejudice, they would be ashamed for having lost so much time, and expressed so much Heat about a thing which merited it not. Every one knows how many Disputes the subject of Grace has caused amongst the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> 'Tis well known with what ardour the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of an Irrespective Science, which they attributed to God, have maintained their Doctrine against those who established an Absolute Decree. This was that which formed two Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their Doctors: This Difference has continued, and is renewed in our time betwixt the <hi>Jansenists</hi> and the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though under other terms. There is no Person ignorant, unto what a degree of Division they have come about this business, and the strange Consequences which are apprehended from it. In the mean time comes a new Doctor, who hath caused the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires of Grace to be Printed, and maintains that all the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is but only in Words. He undertakes to put an end to it, by showing that they all agree in the Foundations, and are all in the same mind with St <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I place in the rank of Questions, which are not essential and fundamental in Religion, such as are made about the business of the Government of the Church, and the Ceremonies instituted for ruling the Exteriour part of its Worship. For how much stir has been made concerning those things, which have no other ground, than the general Rule proposed by St <hi>Paul,</hi> namely,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107899:29"/>
                     <hi>That all things be done with Order and Decency in the Church!</hi> 'Tis sufficient therefore, that in these Matters, we have always before our Eyes, that which may advance the Glory of God, and edifie his Church. For indeed we may dress in a different manner, the proper means for obtaining so good an End.</p>
                  <p>The Use and Application of this General<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Rule, might be left to the Liberty of each particular Church, to do what they should judge most Expedient, according to the Circumstances of the Place, Times, Dispositions of Men's Spirits, and such like. They should only take heed of Introducing in these things some Practice, which might be directly opposite to any of the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Fundamental Doctrines. Some require that the Teachers of the Church should be Equal: and others would have a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and Inferiority amongst them. Some are for an outward Pomp in the Church; and Others would have a great Plainness. Some believe that the Ornaments of the Places of Devotion create a Respect to the Exercise: and Others think that the Meanness of the Place takes off the Thoughts of the Faithful from Material and Carnal Things, to lift them upward to Those which are Coelestial and Divine. Some love Musick, and the Sound of Melodious Instruments in Divine Service; and Others object, that it disturbs the Mind, and carries away the Devotion which should be fixt in those Holy Places. Some are of Opinion that the Riches of the Clergy, their Train, and outward Pomp, gains them the Veneration of the People, who are apt otherwise to Despise them: Others judge that the Poverty and Simplicity of the Ministers of the Church, better accords with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Gospel, and produce more saving Effects in the Minds of Men, than all Worldly Splendour.</p>
                  <p>It is in these King of Questions and Differences, that I shall let you see, we should bear one with another; for I hold, that there may happen Occasions, where One of these Practices may be most Expedient, and most Edifying: and Others, or that which is Opposite to it, may likewise prove of very great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; always provided, that Order and Decency be preserved: Thus must there be a Mutual Toleration amongst Christians, and a Charitable and Brotherly Support one towards another.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>'TIS a generally received Opinion amongst all Christians, that it is from God alone that we must have the Articles of our Faith, and the Rule of our Actions. They agree also in this, that it is in His Word, contained in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that these two things are compriz'd; and that it is from thence, as from Two Fountains, that they must be conveyed down to us. The Councils themselves, namely those which are called General, and to which some Christians do attribute as much Authority and Infallibility, as to the Holy Scriptures, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do confirm this Truth. For they have never undertaken to decide any Point of Religion, but by the Holy Scriptures; They have concluded that they ought to ascend up thither for establishing of any Doctrine, which must have Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongst Christians. And yet have we departed insensibly from this Principle. We have quitted this saving Tenet, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to Man, that which is not due, but to God alone. We have made such Doctrines as are meerly Humane, to pass crowded amongst those which are handed down to us from God; just as they put off false Money by making it glister as much as may be, and then mixing it amongst such as is currant Coin, that it may not be suspected. This is it that has given Scope to Contentions, and afterwards been the grand Cause of Division.</p>
                  <p>Some have been of Opinion that whatsoever specious Pretences, and whatsoever plausible Names have been given to the Decisions of the most famous Assemblies, they are all this while but Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sentiments, which ought to be examined before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. They affirm that they were but particular Men, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o have proposed their Opinions in such Assemblies; that many times in these Occasions, 'tis the Credit, Readiness of Wit, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107899:30"/> Eloquence, or some force of Argument more Specious than So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, which makes their Opinions pass for Articles of Faith. That those particular Persons who compose these Assemblies may be mistaken, notwithstanding all their Lights and Knowledg; That by consequence, a Company of them, how numerous soever they be, may be subject to Defects, and to the Errours of the Members whereof they are composed. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That the very Diversity or Difference which is sometimes found in the Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by them, justifies enough their Opinion, and makes us see that all these Decisions are subject to Tryal.</p>
                  <p>Others who are of a different Sence, maintain that without the Decisions of the Councils, we should have but an imperfect Rule of our Belief. That the Holy Scriptures do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all that which is taught us in the Church. That there are also many things in the Holy Scriptures that have need of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and Interpretation. That on these Occasions there is none to whom we can have better Recourse, than to the Church, to whom God has promised the ordinary Conduct of his Spirit. That the Church cannot make her Voice be better understood, and declare to us her Sence, in a fashion more Authentick, than when she is Represented, and as it were United in these Solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies. They are perswaded, that when such an Assembly is lawfully gathered, it does of Right enjoy an Infallibility, equal to that of the Holy Scripture, and that it is God himself, who speaks as much in one as the other.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time both one and the other, agree in this Point, that the Scripture is Infallible, that it is the Foundation of the Truth, and the soveraign Rule of all Holiness. The latter also pretend, that although they plead in favour of the Authority and Infallibility of the Church, they find Argument enough in the Scriptures for maintaining their Doctrine, and confounding of Errour.</p>
                  <p>But let us, for the present, lay by this Controversy of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, and return back to that Principle, which all agree on. It may be, we may draw Rules and Directions enough from thence, so that we should not be obliged to enter upon this other Dispute; which shall be more particularly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Third Part of this Treatise. Let us therefore only
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107899:31"/> hear what <hi>Tertullian</hi> says upon this Subject. <hi>Apolog. Chap.</hi> 47. Where giving a Reason of the Divisions which he saw in his time about Christian Religion: He says, that, <hi>Those who have separated themselves from the Communion of the Church, have in the doing it, violated their Faith to Jesus Christ; For He it is, that hath taught us the Rule of Truth, which he caused to be delivered to us by those holy Men, who had the Happiness to hear his Word, and receive his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Instructions; That all which is not Conformable to That Rule, has been invented by new Doctors, who came not till after those blessed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples of the Son of God.</hi> In this manner hath this worthy Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ended up to the very Fountain Head of this Evil, and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Original of those miserable Divisions. And St <hi>Augustin</hi> in that remarkable Passage against <hi>Maximin</hi> the <hi>Arrian, Let us lay aside</hi> (said he) <hi>all Prejudices which may conceive, I from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Nice, <hi>and thou from that of</hi> Arminum <hi>or</hi> Rimini; <hi>Let us, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, as when a Man hath once given way to some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Principle, what Care soever he takes to avoid the ill Consequences thereof, he is sure to fall insensibly upon them. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise whatsoever Corrective may be brought for the taking away from the Antimony its malignant Qualities, there shall neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less break forth some ill Effects of it.

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the Dislike which has been had at the Simplicity of Christian Religion, has been an Occasion, that Men have given it a different Aspect from that which it had in its beginning.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Do not believe that there is any Christian, who will not agree with me, that Christianity was never more pure, more Holy, nor more proper to induce its Professors to Vertue, than in its Birth. That was a time wherein the saving Principles of the Gospel, were only received from the Mouth of the Son of God, and from those Holy Men whom he had inspired. This was the true Golden Age of the Church, abounding in Saints, in Confessors, and in Martyrs. And I believe that this Truth will also be granted me, that then at that time, when Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was so pure, and exempt from Errour, its Doctrine was also most Simple and most Naked: It was free from all those Subtil Questions, which some caused to be started up in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages. It was not subjected to the burthensom Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so many Ceremonies, which are as strange Habits and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, wherewith it has been since cloathed.</p>
                  <p>There are found amongst us two sorts of Persons, which have much contributed to this Evil. The First are those subtil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who besides their own natural Wit, are still more refined in the Schools of the Philosophers: The Second are such as are pleased at some Show and Appearance, who have not yet been able to quit the Inclinations, which the World has inspired them with, for these outward things, and who cannot forbear having some Esteem for the Pomp of the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Ceremonies.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:107899:32"/>
                  <p>The First Sort have thought that Christian Religion would be much more considered, if it should contain many Mysteries, which were obscure and difficult to comprehend; Judging, that as Plainness causes Contempt, Obscurity would gain it Respect and Veneration. They have formed Difficulties upon all the Points of Religion, to exercise their Wits on; And to shew their Skill and Learning, which they bring with them from the Schools, they have caused Doubts to arise from the Things which are most easie and dear. In a word, they have changed the Christian School, into a School of Branglings and Disputes: Which heretofore caused a certain Person to say, That <hi>the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had been the Patriarch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the Hereticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Spirits, who are for having some Shew in Religion, fancy, that if the Christian Church, were but reduced into the Simplicity which it had in its first Rise, it would have but a Few Followers. They see Men naturally do love that which pleases the Senses, and which conveys Devotion into the Heart, by the Eyes and Ears. It is from this Notion, that all these different Ceremonies are crept in, which we see practised among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. They have retained <hi>Jewdaism,</hi> nay more, they have brought in such <hi>Paganism,</hi> as they have deemed most proper, to imprint, by outward Objects, some inward Motives to Devotion and Zeal. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y have Imagined that they could with Profit, make use of those Things, which the others abused. They have supposed, that that was the way to Sanctifie the prophane Vessels of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> and bring back that to its true Use, which nourished the <hi>Pagan</hi> Superstition.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, how specious soever the Reasons and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are, which one, and the other alledge in their own Favour; These are they, who have given the first Stroke to the Peace and Union of the Church. For if at first, they had religiously kept themselves to the Small Number of Rules, which the Gospel prescribes us, they had never separated into so many Sects, as have been formed, concerning such Questions as the Curiosity of Men has caused to be raised. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> tells us, that his Yoke is easie to bear. He invites All, even to the very little Children, to believe in Him; which he would not have done, if the Faith had certainly brought with it all those abstruce Rules and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107899:32"/> which are proposed to us now. The Holy Scriptures do present but very few Doctrines, in comparison of the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Virtue, which are there made us. And the Gospel▪ is not given us, but that we should believe <hi>Jesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and that in believing it, we may have Life through his Name; <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. To be Lawfully Baptized, It is sufficient to believe from the Heart, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the Son of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reduces all his Preaching to this only Point; That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the <hi>Messias,</hi> foretold by the Prophets, that he was to be Crucified, and Rise again from the Dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. The same reports, That the Extent of his Knowledge is to know <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and Him Crucified. The Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> requires not more of him that would approach near to God, than the Knowledge of two Things; That there is One God; And that he is the Rewarder of those who seek after Him. And St <hi>James</hi> makes Pure Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Blameless before God, to consist in Visiting the Widow and Fatherless in their Afflictions; and in keeping themselves from being defiled by this World. As if they would have said, That the Principal Design of Religion is, to bend all ones Study to Sanctity, to Purity, and to Charity.</p>
                  <p>The Creed of the Apostles, contains whatsoever is Essential in the Rules of Christian Religion, And what that teaches us is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Consolation of our Souls, and to induce us to a Holy Life. Let us but examine all the Apologies of the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, written on purpose to discover their Opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> but a very few Articles of Faith, as concerning the Existence of God, the Incarnation of our Lord, his Birth, Life, Death and Resurrection. Hence it is that they have defended themselves from the Accusations which were brought against them; That they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Religion is but the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretext which these People make use of, for advancing their Affairs, and establishing their Fortunes in the World. 'Tis no more to them than an Accessary to attain to their Principal, which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107899:33"/> is their aggrandizing and making themselves Powerful. And since it is not the Glory of God which they propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Religion, we must not wonder, if God permits Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to ruin a Design, the Motives whereof are so Vile and so Shameful.</p>
                  <p>When a Religion is once established in a State, the most do not examine whether or no it be well founded in its Rules; and whether it contribute to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lvation of all, or no. Every one consults whether or no the Profession which is made thereof, may be accommodated to the posture of his own Affairs, and to the subsistence of his Family. The most principal Persons of the State think they ought to maintain it against all others, at what Price soever. They think, that if they should leave to Private Men a Liberty of Examining it, there would happen a great deal of Trouble by the Contradiction of those who might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. So that it is not at all any Pious Motive, which incites them to maintain that Religion which bears the Sway, but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest meerly Politique and Worldly. It is not the Advancement of God's Glory, and Defence of the Truth, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to themselves: 'Tis their own Advancement, which they endeavour to manage by the Rules of Humane Prudence; and this Prudence ordinarily suggests to them, not to exercise any but an outward Devotion, for the Attaining of their En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. Whence it comes to pass that God, cursing this Conduct, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, in despight of all their Prudence, some Bold Spirits to arise up amongst them, who freely discover their Opinions; daringly publish the Defects of that Religion, which bears so much Sway, make themselves Heads of Factions, and sow Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, not only in Religion, but likewise in the State. I leave it to those who have but the least insight into the History of our Times, to make Proof of this Truth, by Examples known to every one.</p>
                  <p>The Interests of private Persons do not work with less power on their Spirits, than the Interests of a State busie the Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians who govern it: And their Passions likewise do not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute less to these Disorders and Divisions in matters of Religion. How many are there, who coming to establish themselves in a Country, where divers Religions are tolerated, do presently
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107899:34"/> question which of these Religions they ought to follow; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they consult this kind of Prudence, which obliges them to find out that Profession, which is the probablest to turn best to account. If there be any great Man in the State, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect some Support or Protection from Him; they take special care not to throw themselves into any Communion which their Protector shall not approve of. They particularly encline to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themselves in the Religion of the Prince, whom they are more afraid of offending, than their own Consciences.</p>
                  <p>Others there are likewise, who although they see one of these Communions less considerable in the State than the other is, by reason of its Weakness and small Number of Followers, will not yet forbear to list themselves there, meerly for some Carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest: 'Tis very often Ambition, and the desire of Rule, which carries them thither; they hope to acquire more Reputation, in having some eminent Employment in a simple Barge, than if they were thrust amongst ordinary Seamen in a great Fleet. They make a large Preamble to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They declare that they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a Religion abandoned and persecuted, before one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might have had sufficient Profits and Advancements; and if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> obtain not speedily what they aimed at, they let them know that they are powerfully solicited to forsake them, and that their falling off will cause a considerable Rent amongst them.</p>
                  <p>These People draw false Conclusions from their false Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as if Ambition and Self-interest did not many times work by occult Ways, and under false Pretences; and as though Men travelled not sometimes to a Vain Glory by back Ways, and to advance their Affairs in the World, under the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sk of Zeal and Devotion; and these are chiefly such as make the greatest Noise in their Society: These are they who are the most Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in Appearance: They who declaim most highly against such as do not approve of their Party: Lastly, These are they, who contribute most of all to Division; to strengthen, in favour of it, a Body whereof they would make themselves Masters; So that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107899:34"/> in the choice of a Religion, Men do ordinarily take that which is clear contrary to the Precept of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> They do not, <hi>above all things, seek the Kingdom of God, and the Righteousness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> But they seek every other thing before that which is most important.</p>
                  <p>We should not only prefer God's Interest and Glory before our Temporal Advantages, but we ought not to desire those very Advantages, but for the Glory of God, and our own Salvation; and leave the whole Disposal thereof to the Providence of Him, who takes particular Care of the least Creatures. These People on the contrary are very inquisitive to know in what way of Worship they may live most commodiously with all their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; afterwards they inform themselves, and seek about on all sides, by what Means soever to widen their Consciences, that so they may gratify, without Trouble or Remorse, the Pashon which rules them.</p>
                  <p>After that, Judge if these Men (so disposed) are not in a Condition, blindly to follow those, to whom they have joyned themselves: If they who move not, but by such ill Principles, are not capable of being made Subject to whatsoever shall be desired of them, to advance their own Society, and ruin others. Hence it is that all those dangerous Prejudices do arise, which are in Religion, like a thick Cloud, that obscures the Understanding. This it is, that hinders us from discovering the Truth, and from working by the Motives of a sincere Charity.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107899:36"/> before. Insomuch that on these Occasions, we see but few, who give not all the Applause to the Doctors of their Communion, and esteem not the Others, but as confuted and baffled Teachers. So as I dare boldly say, that all these Writings, and all these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, being far off from producing any good Effects, shall but cause the Minds of Men to be more wedded to their Opinions, and remove them further off from any Sincere Reconciliation. Let us say then with St▪ <hi>Augustine, Epist.</hi> 122. That this Evil has more need of Tears, and Lamenting, than of large Writings and great Volumns. And many times the Discourses which have been us'd for obliging the vanquished to follow another Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have served but still more to animate the Parties, and fortifie them in their Separation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore many seeing the small Success of this Remedy, which has been endeavoured, have judged that they ought to change their Method, and work the Cure after another way. For effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, they have distinguished between such Societies of Christians, whom they have believed to have gross and dangerous Opinions; and others whom they supposed not to lye in so great Errour. As to the first, they have given them over as Sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in so deplorable▪ a Condition, that their Disease is stronger than all Remedies: But they have made some Steps towards the Assistance of the latter; They have offered them a Hand of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and made them hope to meet together, in certain Terms and Expressions, whereon they should agree.</p>
                  <p>This is it, that all those have endeavoured, who have hitherto applyed themselves to the Re-uniting of the Catholicks, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants. This is the way which they have followed, who would have agreed the <hi>Luth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eep, and give some kind of present Ease to this Evil, than to Cure it perfectly by any effectual Remedy.</p>
                  <p>There has been made a certain Mixture of Doctrines, and a Composition of Things which can never be Incorporated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereas they ought to have laboured to purifie Christian Religion, and separate it from that Mixture of all Strange things, and bring it back to its first Simplicity. Indeed they have failed herein, for want of looking up to the Fountain-Head of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to discover what first made this Separation among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of what Communion soever they be. We ought therefore, since it is so, to find out a Means how to propound to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in general, something wherewith to satisfie them in the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>res which shall be made them, and cause them all to understand the Interest which they have to Re-unite themselves into▪ one and the same Principle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In short,</hi> Some there are who have fancied, that Councils, and General Assemblies might put a good Period to this Evil, by their Authority, and great Learning; but many times Interests and prejudicate Opinions reign as well in these Assemblies, as amongst the particular Persons which compose them. For we ordinarily see, that these kind of Companies make Mens Spirits more obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their first Sentiments, and cause a less Disposition in them to an Agreement. We see besides, that these same Assemblies are very seldom formed, but under the Authority of one of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cts of Christians, and that whatsoever is proposed therein, is to Fortifie them the more against others, and to fix them more and more in their first Opinions. This is that which has caused many absolutely to reject all Assemblies of this Kind, and has been the Ground of that common Saying, that <hi>Every General Council begets a War.</hi> Therefore for the Right Management of this Design, all Christians generally should agree together upon all things which regard their common Good; they should all work upon the same Principle; and if they convene any Assembly for the attaining to so good an End, no Christian Society should be suffered to prevail by its Authority, and Power over the rest: But all should have the▪ Liberty of proposing their Opinions, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107899:37"/> be afterwards determined by that which shall be for the Common Good.</p>

                     <p>To lay aside all Prejudices against Others, and to throw off all Particular Interests, that so nothing may be proposed by us, but the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Souls.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have already shewn, that there is nothing ruins more the Peace of the Church, than the Interest of Particular Persons. That the greatest Obstruction to this Re-union, is our Prejudice against other Societies, which in time strengthens our pre-conceived Opinions. Therefore what we should do out of hand for the Successful carrying on of this good Design, is, to cast off all particular Interests, and all these Prejudices; I mean, not t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

And it is farther requisite, to lay aside all those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessions of Spirit, which may render us less inclinable to those Propositions of Peace, that may be offered us. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that were we free from such Pre-engagements and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, we should favourably hearken to all Overtures of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation which should be made us.</p>
                  <p>As for the Lawful Interests which I speak of, and are sit to be proposed in this Affair, they are such as have no Regard to any Imaginary Good, but are Real, Solid, and Essential to Man. Also this same Good is never separated from the Interests of the Glory of God, and the Establishment of Truth.</p>
                  <p>I exclude therefore out of the Rank of Right Motives, which should guide us in the Search of the True Christianity: First of all, whatsoever has relation to the Advantages and Commodities of the present Life. I put into this Number those which respect
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107899:38"/> Honours, Riches, Pleasures, and whatsoever is the Object of any Carnal Desire. And hither I also refer whatsoever contributes to the satisfaction of our inordinate Passions, where they revolt from the Obedience which they owe to Reason. I am certain that this Principle will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>After this, to do well, we must cast away from us all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Prejudices against others, and High Conceipts of our own Opinions, which cause almost all the Disorders that ordinarily happen in the Church. These are so many Clouds which darken the Understanding, and hinder Men from seeing distinctly the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107899:39"/> upon which they should make their judgment. They are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Glasses, which represent to us all we look on, the clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, as dyed with their own colour. How would you have a Man, whose Spirit is filled with an infinite number of Ideas, upon which he is already fixed, be able, after this, to make room for those which are Opposite to them, although they are really more effectual to his Salvation? They must be all excluded to compare them together without Prejudice; they must be seen Naked, and that held, which shall be judged most Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>There has been not long since proposed, in Philosophy, an excellent way of right Disputing, and keeping a direct Course for searching out the Truth. They say, that for effecting of this, all pre-conceived Opinions, and Pre-possessions of Spirit must be absolutely cast away. That then they must not take up any, but the most plain Notions, and such Propositions as cannot be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled at by any who have the least use of Reason. Why then cannot we imitate this manner of procedure in Religion? Can we not for a while set aside all these Opinions, which we defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heretofore with so much Eagerness and Heat, to examine them afterwards more freely, and without any Passion, holding closely to our common Principle which is the Holy Scripture? Can we not without any Prejudice look upon the Foundations of Religion, which all they who are called Christians do generally acknowledg, and the Principles which they all agree upon? Would it not be an infallible means to know with a disinterested Mind, how we should advance in a right way, and how we might build upon a solid Foundation, and such as should be approved by every one?</p>
                  <p>My desire therefore is, that these Prejudices and strong Fancies of our own Opinions may be quitted, which bind us in a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather by false Appearances, than by Judgment and Reason. Hence is it that some boast of their Antiquity, the Succession of their Pastors, the Government of their Communion, their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Advantages, the Riches, Splendour and Magnifience of their Temples, and Ornaments. Hence is it that others glory in their Plainness, and the Smalness of their Number, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which is made of them in Society, and other things of this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107899:39"/> Nature, which the World cannot relish. Lastly, there are others extolling the Knowledg and Talents of their Doctors; the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Austerity and Mortifications of their Votaries, the Zeal of their Martyrs, and other Exteriour Things, and Accidentals to Religion. For it may so happen, that all these may meet in Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, which are not approved of by those, who boast of them, as so many Titles in their Favour.</p>
                  <p>There are likewise some, who, although they seem not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any thing, but Religion, by putting away whatsoever is not Essential to it, yet cannot forbear falling into Prejudices and Errours of dangerour Consequence. Such are those who believe that their Doctrine is to be preferred before others, by reason of the Number of the Learned Men which defend it, the Arguments with which they appear to be supported, and the Great Motions of Virtue which they seem to inspire. They consider not that all these things may be also observed in the Societies, whose Doctrine they do not approve: That at least the Followers of the Rest might make a like Judgment of their Doctrine; seeing the Friends of each of them are pre-possessed with Reasons in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Own.</p>
                  <p>We ought therefore for a while to cast off all these particular Sentiments, which form the divers Societies of Christians; in such manner, that it should not be the Authority of any One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that should bear sway over the Rest; but the sole Infallible Rule of Truth; which is the Word of God: For, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing That is universally received by all Christians, there ought to be no difficulty, in submitting to whatsoever it clearly teaches us. This being so, how can we doubt of the Blessing of God, upon such an Enterprize, since we have no other thing for our Interest, than his Glory; for our Rule, than his Word; and for our End, than our Salvation.</p>

                  <p>WHen we say, that for the attaining to a perfect Re-union, we must be free from all obstinate Prejudices; I mean not thereby, the establishing of an Indifference, and leaving Mens minds in a Suspence, without knowing what to resolve on. 'Tis only to render many unsure Foundations, suspected, and to search out for One which may be Firm and Solid, and which the whole World should agree to be so. Now there is but One of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that is the Sacred Word of God, which he hath given us by the Ministry of his Servants. He hath given it us expresly to be the Rule, both of our Faith, and all our Actions, in what concerns his Service.</p>
                  <p>And it is too evident that all do not agree on Other Matters. All do not hold that the Church is Infallible. All do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that there is an Unwritten Word, which is of as much Authority, as that which is the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107899:40"/> as I have ever heard, any Christian who denyed to entertain it, as being an Extract and Compendium of the Gospel. And, if that had been well practised, which the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, of not adding any other Doctrine to this Symbole, we had never seen Christianity divided into so many Sects, as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it is.</p>
                  <p>I shall not here undertake to prove the Divinity of this Holy Writing; as having now only to do with Christians, who all acknowledge it. This is a thing that I may possibly handle in the third Treatise, which I have promised to publish, in the Preface to this Piece. For my Design therein is, to let all People of the World see the Advantages of the Christian Religion above others: I shall also there endeavour to give to every one, a Means of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it without these obstinate Prejudices, which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make us reject any Doctrine, how tending soever to our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>At the present, me-thinks, for the working with Success to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a good Re-union, we should rise to a Principle wherein we all agree; It would be a very good Step towards a Peace, when we should find a Subject wherein we could all Unite. For, according to that Universal Maxim, Things which agree in a Third, agree also together. If therefore we all receive the Word of God, as our Soveraign Rule; might we not probably hope, that we may be Re-united in other things, which are but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances on that; especially, if after we have cast away from us all our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, being perswaded that the Doctrine contained in these Holy Scriptures is Divine, that it is True, that it is Infallible, and that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Holy, we shall without doubt conclude, that it is our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Rule: That it prescribes to us what we should All be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and receive for our Salvation. And as this Word expresly forbids us to Add, Diminish, or Alter any thing in the Doctrine which it lays open to us, we should look upon all other Doctrines received in any other Society of Christians, as very Suspicious: We should not receive them, till after a careful Examination of them, and upon Sure Conditions, how Specious soever the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were, under which they would make them to pass to us.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107899:41"/> Although they should give them to us meerly as Explications, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrations, and Consequences drawn from this Word: We should however look upon them, but as Essays of Man's Wit, whose Infirmity appears in all his Actions. All his Meditations, his Application, his Reasoning, his Humility, his Prayers, and his Fastings, cannot hinder, but that there will remain still great Weaknesses of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>This Diversity must not alter the Peace of the Church. It is not just, that agreeing together in the essential Points, we should break the Bonds of our Amity, for things which are not essential. How many Brothers are there, who although they be of different Employments, yet for all this leave not off their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving together as Brothers, and making up one and the same Family. I would therefore have an Accomodation made herein, according to the Customs and Practices of the Places in which they live. That in all parts, where they should Inhabit and Sojourn, they might be subject to the Community of Christians, which should be there established, without Condemning or Blaming other Customs. That we should rather believe charitably, that every one has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed herein the Order which has been supposed to be most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and most requisit to Salvation; seeing that still the Principle which is comprehended in few Articles, continues firm.</p>
                  <p>Thus St <hi>Paul</hi> was accustomed to do, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 33. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to please, and accommodate all matters, without seeking after particular Conveniences, but only the Salvation of many.</hi> And when he saw any who would be Contentious in these things, He only answered them thus, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 16. We have no such Custom.</hi> Showing that it argues a Contentious Spirit, and an Enemy to the Peace of the Church, to be unwilling to follow Order and Custom in things of this Nature. We should always fix here, That we ought not, barely upon account of human Institutions, to separate one from another, seeing we break with those, who embrace the same Doctrine which we do, clearly taught us in the Word of God, under pretence that they have not the same Practice with us in the outward part of Religion.</p>

I say the same of Interpretations that may be given to some obscure passages, which should not cause any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, be the diversity never so great, which is there met with. There is but one sole occasion for allowing it, and that is, When a particular Interpretation overthrows some one of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines, or that they would make it to pass, as issued out from the very Mouth of God himself.

                  <p>To which I may in the first place say, That if there should be no other End proposed herein, than this, of Labouring for the Glory of God, and the Peace of his Church, it might be hoped that he would second with his Grace, so laudable a Design. It is to attend his Work, it is to establish his Reign in the World, it is to build up his House. What? will he refuse the Succours of his Grace, to those who shall have no other aim, but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Interests? Therefore when we shall meet with Difficu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ties, which we cannot Remedy upon the suddain, we should not for that be discouraged, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t expect from the goodness of God, the Success of so Pious an Enterprize. It must not be thought strange, if at present God has left Christians as destitute of the Graces, which he showered down in the first times of Christianity. His Spirit is not to be found among Tempests, and amidst Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds: How should it be among Christians, divided into so many Sects, and animated with the Spirit of Division, which reigns by Passion and Violence? So soon as Charity is awakened, we shall then labour for the Common Peace: That Spirit which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the first Disciples, who were met together with One Accord, in One Place, will Inspire us in such manner, that this great Design will go forwards beyond all our Hopes.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, seeing that God does not forbid us the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make his Glory shine, with this small Stock of Prudence, which we have received from his Grace. I suppose we might happily proceed after this order in our Design.</p>
                  <p>It would be necessary, with all speed to cause to be dispersed, Writings of this Tenor, in divers Languages, and send them into all Places, where there shall be any Christians, of what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession soever they be. This would serve to undeceive an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of pre-possessed Spirits, and make them hope for the Success of an Enterprize, which hitherto has been supposed impossible to finish. This would waken in divers places many Private Persons, who would have an Inclination to Peace, and on whom God had poured his Grace, proper for contributing to so good an End. I am assured that they would be ravished to have so favourable an Occasion of working for the common Good of Christendom. They would cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ainly be astonished at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that they should have been so long time without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107899:49"/> a Discovery of this Business, and without taking it by its true Measures. They would bless God for having opened so fair a Port, to enter into so great a Calm, after so many Tempests. They would suitably qualifie themselves, for the attaining to so desirable an End. They would labour with all their Industry, to bring thither those of their Communion; and altogether would strive to suspend for a while their Judgments in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Articles, until by common Consent all That should be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was requisite to so happy a Design.</p>
                  <p>Besides the writings which should b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> employed to this end; Familiar Conversations, and particular Discourses would much contribute thereunto. It is thus that we might Do, and that we ought mutually to lend our Assistance, for the clearing of these matters. We ought always to have in Prospect, the Glory of God, and the Peace of his Church; and this should be our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Business. There is not any thing, which oftner puts a stop to the Execution of our greatest Designs, than the want of frequent unmasking, and laying them open. For the well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, this must be often attemped, and all the difficulties by little and little removed, which shall Occur therein.</p>
                  <p>We are all generally more Curious to entertain our selves in converse about any other thing, rather than that which is most Necessary. The Subjects most ordinarily fallen upon, in those Companies which are esteemed to be the most regular, are full of Vanity, if not Sinful. Newes of what passes in the World; Affairs of State; Explication of some difficult passages of the ancient Authors; Some questions of the Mathematicks, or of Physicks, and things of this nature, are the ordinary Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of these famous Companies, which we so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire. If any one should propose such a Subject as this, which I treat of; either it is Coldly received, or passed over Lightly, to go to some other, which may give more pleasant Relish to the Company, and be better accommodated to the humours of the Age. And yet what more worthy Subject is there of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations, than that which regards the geveral Good of all Christians? Let us bless the happy moment, wherein we have been brought to the Discovery of this Generous Design, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107899:49"/> contribute our Endeavour towards its good success; if we can let our selves be vanquished by this Exhortation!</p>
                  <p>Moreover it would be convenient, that all Those who have found themselves perswaded of the Truth and Advantage of this Proposition, should employ their greatest Care in advancing the Execution of it. If in Traffick, Men expose themselves to so many Perils, to transport their Commodities from one Country to another, in hopes of some small profit; Shall we sit still with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating the most precious Treasure, and greatest Advantage which can arrive to Society? It is not here to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the number of those who shall be Sharers in this good, will diminish the Portion of any particular Person: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the increase of this Number, will augment the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Joy of those, who make a part thereof: As those that follow Armes, rejoyce to see their Side grow stronger, and at the same time conceive thereat both Hopes and Joy. For, if we act in this Affair, but for the glory of God, the good of his Church, and our own Salvation, as we have even now asserted; the more true Believers we see Re-united together, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this end, the more Joy shall we have, and the more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But if private Persons are obliged to contribute to so Glorious an Enterprize: I believe that those who have any Employment in the Church, in whatsoever Society it be, ought to be assistant therein, by a particular Engagement. Their Profession calls them to it, their Charge obliges them to it, and the Lights which they pretend to have above the Vulgar, ought only to guide them this way. They are as well responsible for the Souls of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as for their Own. They should not propose any other Interests, than those which are joyned to the Interests of their Master; and His Glory only ought to adorn theirs. If they use it otherwise, they are bad Servants, and Stewards of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which have been committed to them. But if they once strive with Zeal, to promote this great Work; besides their own Comfort, the Succeess of it will make them readier, and more assur'd. People have commonly their Eyes on them, to follow their Steps, and imitate their Examples; So that they draw after them whole Troops, Societies, Communities and
<pb facs="tcp:107899:50"/> Sects, as it suffices Him to gain the Officers of an Army, who would make Himself Master of all the Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>But especially, I make account, that those who are able to give the greatest Stroke on this Occasion, are Princes, and all those who have the Government of States, and Management of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs. They can maintain with their Authority all these Reasons, which shall be employed in this Noble Enterprize: And their Power will be very Efficacious, for making the Exhortations of others Valued. It is not, that I mean this Affair should be plainly carried on by the Force and Authority of Men. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding must herein be cleared, to gain over the Heart and the Affections, which is better done by Reasoning, than Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and by the Force of Arguments, than by that of Arms.</p>
                  <p>But since there may be some particular Persons so wedded to their old Opinions, that for their Worldly Interests, they would reject the Good, which would be procured for them: It would be fit to hinder these People, by a Superiour Authority, from crossing so happy a Design. If for Example, some Clergy-men, of any Community whatsoever, could not resolve to quit their Temporal Advantages, which are of more weight with them, than the Publick Interest: The Authority of Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, would serve very well to reduce them to that which was Reason and Justice. There would also herein be this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage expected, from those who have the Power in their Hands; namely, that by the Correspondence and Alliance, which they have together, they might make this Good, Universal to all Christians. They might likewise Joyn their Forces, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the Boldness of Infidels, and all Enemies to the Name of Christians, who would oppose themselves to so Holy a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, They might maintain against all others, those Persons who would enter into this Holy Communion: But forasmuch as this is one of the most powerful Means to attain to this End, and which deserves more Important Considerations, I reserve it to a particular Treatise, if this first Work shall be favourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Answers to the Objections, and Difficulties which may be formed against this Design.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere can be no Advantage proposed, which meets not with its Difficulties; We cannot fetch Gold out of a Mine, but with much Trouble; The Earth is not made Fertile, but when it is Digged and Plowed with great Care; and the Success of the most Admirable Enterprizes is not obtained, but by surmounting with Industry, all the Obstacles which are met with, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of them. And yet this Trouble we have in attaining these most Excellent Goods, is that which contributes much to their Glory. It is a poor Common Vertue which finds no Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in its Operations; The praise of Heroick Vertue consists in the conquering of great Difficulties. So that this Project would be less admirable than it is, if it could be effected without Pain, and if the Execution thereof were easie. But what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections may be made to this, and Difficulties met with herein; will be altogether such, as that we shall be easily able both to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the One, and Remedy the Other.</p>
                  <p>Some will presently be apt to say, That to attempt this, is in a manner to go about to hinder an Effect, which must necessarily happen. That it is, as if one should undertake to stop the Course of the Stars, and hinder the Revolution of the Seasons. That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and his Apostles have foretold there should be Heresies, Dissentions, and Schisms in the Christian Church. That this is permitted by the Providence of God, to make evident the Zeal and Constancy of his Faithful Servants: Insomuch that it would be to strive against the Eternal Decrees, and Rules appointed in the Counsel of God, to endeavour to prevent the Division or Dissention among Christians.</p>
                  <p>But for satisfying this Objection, besides what has been said upon this Point, at the beginning of this Treatise. There is but one thing to consider, which is, that this Prediction is not only grounded upon a Decree of God, for the ordering of things
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107899:51"/> which should happen in his Church; but upon an effect of the evil disposition of the Spirits of Men, which is cause of the Dis-union: And that hinders us not from labouring to Remedy this Cause, and put a stop to these deplorable Effects. So that what <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> has foretold us of the Fire which he was come to kindle in the Earth, by the Preaching of his Gospel▪ hinders not his Servants from running, with great affection, to Extinguish it, and to stay the great Burning which this Flame might cause.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if it were so, that this Evil falls out, because it has been foretold; Yet it does not import thus much, that it should abide conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ually. Is it not enough that it has taken place for so many Ages? Is it not time to stop its Course and see an end of it? So will the Prophesie have had its accomplishment in our Fathers days, and we shall, in ours, enjoy the Calm after all these Tempests. Let us add hereunto, that this very Word, which foretells us these Divisions, makes us also hope for an estate of Peace and Quiet in the Church. It makes times of Refreshment and Ease to succeed all these great Disturbances, and assures us that there shall be such a firm Peace in the Earth, that we shall see those Creatures, which are the greatest Enemies one to the other, that is to say, those Spirits, wherein is the most Contrariety, dwell and unite together. Who knows but that we may live to enjoy those Happy Times? Who knows but in our days we may see this general Peace among all Christians? And I durst promise, that by the Assistance and Bounty of God, this shall come to pass, if our Sins do not put a hinderance to it, and our particular Interests more sway us, than the general good of Christendom.</p>
                  <p>It must be said in the second place, that this Design of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Christians to acknowledg, but so small a Number of Heads in Christian Religion, approved by every one, is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the Apostles Doctrine, and to the Practice of the Primitive Christians. Those who dispute so strongly against the Errours which arose in their times; Those who condemned with so much Indignation all who did not conform to the Holy Doctrine, which they received from the Lord; Is there any likelihood that they would have harkened to these Propositions of bearing one with another, and a charitable condescending in these Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Would St <hi>Paul</hi> have lissened to such accommodation, who
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107899:51"/> writ with so much sharpness against the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who had suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to be seduced by certain False Teachers? Would St <hi>John,</hi> who refused to have any converse with Hereticks, have approved of this Overture?</p>
                  <p>To which I Answer, that what perswaded these Holy Men, to act on this manner, was, that they regarded not so much the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Opinions, which they disapproved, as the evil Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those who went about to establish those ill Opinions. They well saw, that what these Persons were about to contrive, was not out of a Spirit of Simplicity and Humility: They observ'd nothing in all their Conduct, but particular Interests of Worldly Honour, Profit, Authority and Rule, which all their endeavours carried them to. These now are Motives, against which we can never make too much Zeal and Indignation appear.</p>
                  <p>But we see they dealt clearly otherwise with such poor People as had been seduced by these Crafty Wits, than they did with these Incendiaries, these Spirits of Lying. They treated Those with Mildness, but These they condemned with Severity: They bore with the First, and had Charity for them, but they had a Holy and Just Anger for the Second: They allowed some Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Former, but granted Nothing to the Latter.</p>
                  <p>We see also how St <hi>Paul,</hi> that Zealous Servant of God, is not afraid in the very Question of the Resurrection of our Bodies, (so important in Religion) of setting a great Value on this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Charitable Bearing one with another. To this might be added, that these Holy Men have been immediately inspired by the Spirit of God, to acknowledg and make known to others these Heavenly Truths. And this being so, they might condemn with Boldness, and with knowledg of the Cause, those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Truth, which appeared to them in the open Day; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at present, we not having these Lights, and this Supernatural and Miraculous Assistance, are obliged to keep our selves strictly to the express terms of the Doctrine contained in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it might be Objected, that this Design is of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Consequence: That it is to give to every one a Liberty of having what Opinion he pleases; and also in matters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, such as have hitherto divided Mens Spirits: That it is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107899:52"/> to give an occasion of falling insensibly into an Indifferency for Religion, and to favour, in some sort, the Contempt of all.</p>
                  <p>Now, as this is a pressing Objection, and able to drive from this Design all good Souls, if it were well founded; I am confident that whosoever shall have well examined the Foundations which I have laid down, will find there is nothing further from my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, than this Consequence, which they would draw from it. This would be to make Darkness arise from Light, and as the Scripture says, to draw Filthiness from that which is Pure, to imagine such effects should proceed from a Cause so Holy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Can that which only tends to the Re-uniting of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the same Opinions, hurry them into Impiety and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Will that which brings us back to the most plain, and most naked Doctrine of the Gospel, cause an indifferency for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to spring from it? What, then, would this be living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion, to be fully perswaded, that there is a God, who hath created Heaven and Earth; who hath made Mankind; who Punisheth the Wicked, and Cherisheth the Good? Is it to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion, to believe firmly that we have no other Means of getting out of the Misery, wherein our Sins have cast us, but by embracing the Promises which God hath made us, in his Son <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> Is it to be Indifferent in matters of Religion, to hold for certain, that there is no way to obtain Life and Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, but by that of Holiness and good Works? Is it to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, wholly to Consecrate our selves to the Service of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules which he hath prescribed us in his Word, under the colour, that there are but few Rules embraced; Yet however embraced, with an entire perswasion of their Truth.</p>
                  <p>I maintain, on the contrary, that all these Defects of Piety, and all these In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>linations to Irreligion, do not proceed from any other cause than this, that Religion has been over-charged with too many curious and strange Questions. I hold that it is this Great Number of Ceremonies, Scrupulous Observations of the Externals of Religion, and such other Trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, which have divided the Minds of Men, and alienated the most tender Affections. For those who are not penetrating enough to search into, and resolve all the Difficulties which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re met with in these kind of Matters,
<pb facs="tcp:107899:52"/> suffer themselves to fall into an Indifferency. They never looked upon Religion, but as a Subject whereon the most subtil and active Wits set themselves a work. Whereas if we did but once reduce Christian Religion to the natural Simplicity of its Rules, it would then discover all its Graces and Beauty, and would be lov'd by us all, because it would have nothing in it, but what was lovely to our Eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> There might be produced other Difficulties, which might occur in the prosecution of this grand Design. Some will say, that if it were a Feasible Thing, it would have long ago come into the Heads of some others, who would have tryed it; And if they did discover it, without making some Attempt in it, it was because they knew the Execution of it to be impossible. That there are too many different Genius's to overcome, too many different Interests to reconcile, too many Jealousies and Distrusts to surmount: That after we shall have begun to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the precedent Evils, there will arise from this Design other New Subjects of Contention and Dispute, and by consequence of Division. But perchance no Body to this present has ever consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this Affair, as I do: It may be, if they have made the same Discovery, they have wanted Application of Spirit to form the Design of it, and clear the Difficulties. For my part, I do not think the Difficulties unconquerable: And I say once more, that would we engage in it with Zeal, and Religious Motives, the Affair would succeed happily, to the great good of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. These Spirits would let themselves be vanquished by the Motions of Piety and Charity. All these particular Interests would give place to that of the Glory of our Soveraign. All these Jealousies and Distrusts would be smothered by an ardent Zeal for the Service of God. And why shall I loose the hopes of succeeding in this generous Design?</p>
                  <p>Did we not see, that at the Disputation at <hi>Poissy,</hi> in the Year 1561. The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> had almost agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about the Terms, wherein the Article of the Communion should be expressed? Yet that is esteemed the greatest Difference amongst them. And had it not been for certain Doctors, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for their particular Interests broke of this Acoommodation, it would then have been seen, that these two Grand Parties would have been reconciled together.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:107899:53"/>
                  <p>Do we not know that at the Conferrence held at <hi>Marporg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Year 1529. between <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> they fell into Agreement about certain Expressions, almost in all the Points of Religion, and it was concluded, that as to those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they could not likewise Agree, they should Bear charitably one with another, and that That should not hinder the Re-union which was to be made. And yet I know that afterwards it was crossed by the ill Dispositions of Bad Spirits.</p>
                  <p>But when all these particular Interests, and prejudicate Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, shall be removed, which have at other times crossed all these fair Designs, what shall hinder us from meeting in that Point and true Center, now at last, wherein all Christians may be Re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Who shall hinder us in those things, wherein it may be, we cannot easily be enlightened from using a Charitable and Brotherly bearing one with another? And that so we may work together as well United Brethren, for the Glory of the Common Father of this great Christian Family, whose Head, the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> cannot be divided? The greatest Rub is in the first Steps, which must be made towards this Re-union, but this is no unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Difficulty.</p>
                  <p>We read in the Relations of Voyages made to the Eastern Countries, that in <hi>Turky, Persia, &amp;c.</hi> All the Christians which are there met with, of whatsoever Sect they be, live together in a perfect Unity, and give mutually all possible Marks of a sincere Friendship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olearius</hi> observes, that in <hi>Persiae</hi> they make no difficulty of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together in their Devotions. And <hi>Peter de la Valle,</hi> a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Gentleman, relates, (<hi>Tom. 2 Ep.</hi> 3.) that when an <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour arrived at <hi>Hispahan,</hi> a Consultation was held, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> which were there, should go to Visit Him, and that by Joynt consent they were of Opinion, that it was the common Interest, to make it appear to that <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prince, notwithstanding some difference that there was amongst them in certain Points of Religion, yet that they lived together in a perfect Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And he adds a very considerable Instance, <hi>Viz.</hi> That in <hi>Constantionple,</hi> all the Christians, both Catholiques and Heretiques (as his phrase is) dwell together in so excellent and perfect an
<pb facs="tcp:107899:53"/> Unity, that once when he lived there, I know not upon what occasion, the Jesuits having fallen into some great trouble; The Ambassadours of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> who otherwise are their mortal Enemies, (as he says) were the first, who spake in their Favour, and made their Business be dispatched, with all the good Success which they could desire.</p>
                  <p>What then hinders Us here in <hi>Europe,</hi> in the Midst of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that we cannot do that by a Motive of Charity, which they in the <hi>Levant</hi> do by the Principle of the Interest of Trade, and Civil Affairs; and that, we drawing again one towards another, should not agree at last in the Fundamental Points, which may Unite Us all together?</p>
                  <p>And although this Design should not be so readily brought to Perfection, Meditation would be very Advantagious, and very Conducing to it. Particular Persons, who shall have tasted of it, would draw much Satisfaction from it; They would be disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, as to many of their pre-conceived Opinions; They would find themselves discharged of a Heavy Yoke; They would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask Christian Religion, and discover its Beauteousest Face, as being most Pure, and most Plain. They would love it, and Dwell together in its Profession, with singular Comfort.</p>
                  <p>I shall also add this same, that if the Proposition should not Succeed so happily, for all Christians in general, it might take Effect in many particular States of <hi>Europe.</hi> I mean amongst those Christians, where there are Diversities of Opinions and Profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions. Could we not, at least in these Places labour herein, for some good Accommodation? And would not the Fruit which grows thence, be capable of inviting Others to take share in it?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Profits and Advantages; which might be hoped for from this Design.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HE must be very dim-sighted, who cannot plainly see the Signal Advantages, which may be expected from so Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Design. It would be an admirable Means for Advancing the Glory of God, to establish his Doctrine in the Purity and Simplicity which is natural to it. Men have been desirous to supply by their Prudence, the Defects which they thought they had observed, in the Conduct of Providence. They thought that God had not in his Word explained Himself, neither Clear enough, nor Amply enough, to be understood, without Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Thence proceeded all these Expositions, Paraphrases, Commentaries, Questions and Disputes, which have opprest, and almost choaked the most Excellent, and most Holy Doctrine, that ever appeared in the World. If therefore we can but once rid her of this Burthen, she will appear in all her Luster again, and establish in its Ancient Purity the Service of Him, who is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by Her.</p>
               <p>Under the Old Covenant, God rejected the Worship, which the most Superstitious amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> offered▪ him; and that because they had modell'd it according to their Fancies, and had rather endeavoured the observance of these Outward things, than the Solidity and Essence of true Piety. God refuses his Graces to those, who have no mind to receive them, meerly Simple and Pure as they are: To mix them with Ours, is absolutely to spoil them.</p>
               <p>And now seeing we are so Unhappy at this present, as not to enjoy the Communication of the Graces of Heaven, nor that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107899:54"/> Commerce which the first Christians had with God, who doubts but that this must needs come from hence, that we have quitted their Simple and Innocent Carriage in Divine Service? We have undertaken to serve Him after our Manner, and we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to know Him, only by such Ideas, which our Capricious Fancies have fashion'd of Him; This has properly been the Cloud, which has intercepted our Sight of Him; This, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, has been the Sin, which being the most Capital of all, has made Him conceal Himself from us, and the Provocation which has obliged his Justice to chastize, by the Deprivement of his Graces, those who have neglected the Simplicity of his Doctrine. We must therefore re-enter into that first State of Simplicity, Humility, and Charity, to recover that which we have lost, that is▪ to say, God and his Graces: and this is what we should hope for, from the Execution of this Design.</p>
               <p>The second Advantage which we may expect, is, that we should find it much easier to extirpate Vice, and to procure the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Manners in Society. We are driven to a necessity of certain Disputes, and strange Controversies, whilst we should be rooting out the Passions, which choak the Fruit of the Doctrine of the Gospel. We make Sallies out upon the Enemy, whilst Sedition molests us within. Let us cast away these unprofitable Questions: We have enough to do, to make Answer to the Reproaches of our own Consciences. We shall never think of Reforming our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whilst we spend the chiefest of our time, in maintaining these impertinent Discourses. We shall not be able to defend our selves from ill Examples, If we employ our Arms in vindicating of indifferent Opinions, which cannot so long be debated <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> without Prejudice to Salvation; especially since this Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Opinions destroys, as it hath been proved, both Charity, which is the Foundation of Christian Vertues, and Humility, which is the Soul of them. The Fire of this Division must first be extinguished, before we can proceed, with Success, towards the Correction of Manners and Reformation of Life. Therefore it is this, that all good Christian Souls do Sigh after.</p>
               <p>We might have great reason to hope that the State would have also a considerable Advantage by this Design. People would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more Tractable, and submit with more willingness to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107899:55"/> Orders of their Governours, when they should see themselves United with them in the same Profession. It hath been always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that Mens affections have never been straightly linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, where their Minds have been divided by different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Moreover, all those Subtilties which we cause to arise about Religion, do ordinarily make Peoples Spirits Inquisitive, Proud, standing upon Punctilio's, Obstinate, and by consequence, more difficult to be brought to Reason and their Obedience. Every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Man pretends to have a Right of taking Cognizance of those Controversal Matters, to interpose his Judgment therein, and then with great Vehemency to defend them. After this, in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State they will take the same Liberty, which they gave themselves in those of Religion. They believe, that if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to Controle the Opinions of their Governours in the Church, where the Service of God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; It should likewise be free for them to Examine the Conduct of those who are set over them in State. Thus the Re-union which I propose, will be a Powerful Means to hold every one in his Duty.</p>
               <p>All Princes of Christendom would draw considerable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from this Design, for besides the Obedience of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of which I have now been speaking, they might strictly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite themselves together; Since these Jealousies, these Distrusts, and these Divisions, which ordinarily arise from Diversity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, comming absolutely to cease, all these Different Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests which separate them, would Unite in One, and the Fruit would be Common to them All. This Interest would carry them on joyntly to oppose themselves to the Enemies of the Name of Christian, and take over them all Advantage, which Reason and Justice could allow.</p>
               <p>Is it not a Strange thing, that since the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, the Protestants, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> have so Rent and Torn each other; we see that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have made so great a Progress a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, by reason of their Divisions? If, when the <hi>Turks</hi> came to fix themselves in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and then afterwards Attacqued the State of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> all Christendom with one Accord had opposed themselves to their Designs; Had they reaped those Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which they had not long since obtained over those two States? Is it not a very Astonishing, not to say a Shameful, thing,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107899:55"/> that some Neighbouring Countries to those dreadful Enemies of all Christians, have formerly thought themselves obliged to treat with them, and that also upon disadvantagious Terms, meerly out of the Distrusts and Jealousies which they have had of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? They shamefully make Peace with the <hi>Turks,</hi> to turn their Arms against the Christians; esteeming it to be running to that which is the most pressing Necessity: Thus the Common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy advanced, and got much Ground amongst us, by reason of our Divisions. To stop therefore this Evil, and utterly to expel them from amongst us, I see no other more Effectual Remedy, than to hasten this Agreement of Opinions, which (without doubt) will be followed by that of Affections.</p>
               <p>The Common People will find herein this Satisfaction, that they shall no more be troubled in Religion, with so great a Number of Questions, and Diversity of Opinions, proposed to them as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation.

                  </gap>h the Eternal Son of God has procured for us. Thus the Simple Artificers, the Labourers, and those who are most Unlearned and Ignorant would be guided in the way of Salvation, and be led to the Enjoyment of Eternal Blessedness. The Doctors, by this Means, would not have so great Advantage over the People, in the Knowledge and Practice of Things Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>It might be said, that hitherto there have been, as it were, two different Religions, in one and the same Religion: The first is of the Learned and Scholars, the other that of the Common People, Women and Children: Yet <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> never had a Double Auditory, He never instructed the Pharisees and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Law otherwise than the Common People: And when He chose Successors to supply His Room, they were Poor Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had more concern in the Instructing and saving of such as were like them in Condition, than boasting their Subtilty in the Disputes of the Schools, and Confounding such as thought to have the Advantage over others in Arguing.</p>
               <p>I am also perswaded, that those particularly, who are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Ecclesiastical Charges, and called to Teach others, will here
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107899:56"/> find great Advantage: They will no more tread upon those Thorns which heretofore they met with, in all those Critical and Unprofitable Questions: They will have no more those Distrusts and Alarms which they gave themselves, doubting if they were not in a wrong Way, and if they misled not others: They will not Fear the Encountring a Doctrine which is Truer than that they Profess. Let them say what they will, this thought oftentimes makes their Hearts ake, who, amongst them, have tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Therefore seeing themselves delivered from all those Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesses, they would acquit themselves of their Charge with much more Joy. They would labour with Pleasure for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Glory of God. They would bend all their Thoughts to stir up every one to a Good Life, and they themselves would be Examples to others, of Vertue, Piety and Charity.</p>
               <p>'Tis often seen, that amidst the Contentions which the Doctors raise about some Niceties of Doctrinal Points, there is little or no Zeal for the Glory of God. They grow so Passionate for the getting of some Advantage in a Dispute, until, at last, they let themselves be mastered and vanquished by their own Passions. Many times strange Controversies make us forget that Business that we should have with our selves; and some study more how to Speak well, and Dispute well, than how to Live well.</p>
               <p>Lastly, who does not see, that if we bring this Design about, it will prove an excellent Means to draw to the Gospel many People, but who look not upon it now with Aversion &amp; Contempt. This Simplicity, this Beauty, and this Facility which is observed in Christian Religion, together with the perfect Unity of the Professors thereof, will be a Powerful Loadstone to Attract to it, all Those, who hitherto have rejected it: When they shall see that this Holy Religion is not made to consist meerly in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that is to say, in outward Grimaces, which most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Terrifie and keep off those that are well inclined towards it, rather than invite them to follow it: When they shall never more hear talk of all those Critical and Troublesome Questions, which are risen up in Christianity: When they shall observe no more particular Interests predominant in the Spirit of Christians: When they shall be convinced, that there is nothing but the Love of God, Charity towards our Neighbour, and the desire of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107899:56"/> well, which inspires them: Lastly, when they shall see in the Faces of these Christians the Marks of true Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which the Christians possesses within: They must have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived themselves of all Sence of Vertue, they must have extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished utterly all Sparks of Reason, and turn sworn Enemies of their own Good, if they desire not to enter into a Society which hath all these Advantages.</p>
               <p>I doubt not also but those Blessed Spirits who continually stand before the Throne of God, will be concerned in the Advantages of this Holy Union; for if they so much interest themselves in the Conversion of a poor Sinner, that they Rejoyce and Sing aloud in the Quire of Glory, will they not make a Solemn Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in Heaven for the Re-uniting of all Christians upon Earth? I am also perswaded, that God, seeing we all bend our Course toward Him, with the same Heart, and the same Affections, will certainly come to Meet and Receive us; He will embrace us in His Mercies, and speak to us in the Motions of His Loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, especially if <hi>we say</hi> to Him with the Author of that Treatise of the Imitation of Christ, <hi>Lib. 1. Cap. 13. I am weary with Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reading so many Things. It is in thee alone, O my God, that all is included which I desire or wish for. Let all Doctors hold their Peace, let all Creatures keep Silence in Thy Presence, and be Thou pleased alone to speak to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wish with all my Heart, that all these Considerations may make such an Impression upon the Spirits of all those who shall read this Writing, that every one may afterwards Contribute, according to his Power, to the Advancement of this Great Work; and that God would favour, in such Manner, our Attempts with his Grace, that we might suddenly see a Happy Success therein, to His Glory, and the Good of all Christians.</p>
               <p>And because my Voice is too weak to awaken them, and draw them out of the Estate where I behold them now; I wish they would hear that of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, whose Voice and Stile all Christians know. He calls to them thus, in <hi>Ephes. 4. Be ye kind one to another in Love, endeavoring to keep the Ʋnity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace. There is but One Body and One Spirit, even as you are called to One Hope of your Vocation: There is but One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, One God and Father of All, who is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107899:57"/> over All, and through All, and in you All.</hi> This Great Servant of God likewise beseeches them all, with Words capable to work upon the Hardest Hearts, speaking to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>If</hi> says he, <hi>there be any Consolation in Christ, if any Comfort of Love, if any Fellowship of the Spirit, if any Bowels of Mercy, if any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion; make my Joy compleat, that ye be of the same Opinion, having the same Charity, being of the same Courage, and acquiescing in the same Thing. Neither let any thing be done amongst you with Strife, or Vain Glory: But rather esteeming one the other in Humility of Spirit more Excellent than himself, not every one regarding his Own particular interest, but that also which appertains to Others. Let there be therefore One Mind in you, like that which was also in Jesus Christ:</hi> To whom, with the Father, be Glory for Ever and Ever,</p>
               <closer>Amen.</closer>
